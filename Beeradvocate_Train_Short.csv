Quite dark orange in color, with a lively carbonation (now visible, under the foam).	Again tending to lactic sourness.	Same for the taste. With some yeast and banana."
1,Red Moon,48213,10325,6.2,English Strong Ale,3,2.5,3,3,3,1235915097,stcules,"Dark red color, light beige foam, average.	In the smell malt and caramel, not really light.	Again malt and caramel in the taste, not bad in the end.	Maybe a note of honey in teh back, and a light fruitiness.	Average body.	In the aftertaste a light bitterness, with the malt and red fruit.	Nothing exceptional, but not bad, drinkable beer."
2,Black Horse Black Beer,48215,10325,6.5,Foreign / Export Stout,3,2.5,3,3,3,1235916604,stcules,"Almost totally black. Beige foam, quite compact, not bad.	Light smell, just a bit of roast, and some hop. A bit too light.	The taste is light oo, and drinkable, with some malt, roast, hints of coffee.	Nothing exceptional, but after all drinkable and pleasant.	Light to average body.	In the aftertaste some dust, somr roast, hint of caramel, and a bit of bitterness.	No defect, drinkable, not bad."

Quite dry, with a good grassy note. Hay. Fresh and pleasant.	More sweet in the mouth, with honey. The hop comes back in the end, and in the aftertaste.	Not bad, but a bit too sweet for a pils.	In the end some vanilla and camomile note.	In the aftertaste, too. Though the hop, a bit too sweet.	Honest."
4,Cauldron DIPA,64883,1075,7.7,American Double / Imperial IPA,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,1293735206,johnmichaelsen,"According to the website, the style for the Caldera Cauldron changes every year. The current release is a DIPA, which frankly is the only cauldron I'm familiar with (it was an IPA/DIPA the last time I ordered a cauldron at the horsebrass several years back). In any event... at the Horse Brass yesterday.		The beer pours an orange copper color with good head retention and lacing. The nose is all hoppy IPA goodness, showcasing a huge aroma of dry citrus, pine and sandlewood. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely in this West Coast all the way DIPA. This DIPA is not for the faint of heart and is a bit much even for a hophead like myslf. The finish is quite dry and hoppy, and there's barely enough sweet malt to balance and hold up the avalanche of hoppy bitterness in this beer. Mouthfeel is actually fairly light, with a long, persistentely bitter finish. Drinkability is good, with the alcohol barely noticeable in this well crafted beer. Still, this beer is so hugely hoppy/bitter, it's really hard for me to imagine ordering more than a single glass. Regardless, this is a very impressive beer from the folks at Caldera."

Appearance: Pours a slightly cloudy yellow/orange color with a half finger of fluffy white head. The head fades to a small layer on top of the pour.		Smell: Very light and crisp. I'm definitely picking up the ginger, but it's not overly powerful. There is a slight sweetness from the malt as well.		Taste: Very light and refreshing. The ginger shows up right away and then fades towards the finish of the sip. The finish is malty and bread like. 		Mouthfeel: The body is on the thin side with smooth carbonation and a very dry finish.		Overall: This is a light and refreshing beer, but nothing spectacular. The amount of ginger is nice, but I would have liked to have more going on."
6,Caldera Ginger Beer,52159,1075,4.7,Herbed / Spiced Beer,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,1318991115,Reidrover,"22 oz bottle from ""Lifesource"" Salem. $3.95 Nice golden clear beer body with a nice sized frothy/creamy white head. Ok aromas..mainlly a bit of ginger speice and some bready malt..simple nice Taste very nice indeed..nice spicy ginger backed with slightly caramel maltiness..simple again but i like . Liked the mouthfeel of this one..very forward carbonation which helps the ginger effect and a lingering ginger in the after taste. Overall a simple ginger brew .I liked it"
7,Caldera Ginger Beer,52159,1075,4.7,Herbed / Spiced Beer,3.5,2.5,2,3.5,3,1306276018,alpinebryant,"Bottle says ""Malt beverage brewed with Ginger and ginger added"" Sounds redundant to me, but lets move on.		Pours a bud light yellow with a tiny white head of small bubbles. The beer is almost as clear as a glass of water with some food coloring in it.		Aroma of light ginger, a very light malt aroma but primarily odorless on the malt side. I wouldn't be completely surprised if there were some adjuncts in here because of the lack of underlying malt flavors. Taste is of a light adjunct lager with a dosing of ginger. Not surprising there. 		This is a light session beer, good for the warmer days of spring / summer. Mouthfeel is extremely light, high carbonation.		Overall decent. This would be great if you were drinking beers on draft at the bar with some friends just hanging out. I wouldn't necessarily seek it out though to drink out of a bottle."
8,Caldera Ginger Beer,52159,1075,4.7,Herbed / Spiced Beer,3.5,3,3.5,4,4,1290454503,LordAdmNelson,"I'm not sure why I picked this up... I like ginger, and it was reasonably cheap compared to the other beers I was looking at. Pours a pale golden color with smallish head. Nose is largely uneventful, some ginger in there, a bit of pear, but mainly normal lager. Taste is pretty good, bringing a bit more of the ginger to the fore. MF was a bit fizzy, not terrible though. Easy drinker, I had no problem finishing the bomber. Interesting, but I probably won't get it again."
9,Caldera Ginger Beer,52159,1075,4.7,Herbed / Spiced Beer,5,3.5,4,4,4.5,1285632924,augustgarage,"Poured from a 22oz bomber into my Drie Fonteinen tumbler. 		Hazy titanium yellow body (which catches the shadows forming a beautiful mysterious gradient) with an incredibly dense pillow of magnolia cream. Heavy persistent head and rich creamy lacing.		Pale malt, asian pear, and a hint of citrus in the nose. A vaguely tropical lager...		Tastes very much like a well done APA, with a nice balance of pale malt and low hop bitterness. The ginger adds to the refreshing character, but isn't readily detectable at first (lacks any ""bite""). Medium-dry finish - very clean and extremely quaffable. I can imagine hibiscus and beets working in small quantities, though I think they omitted those for this version...		Light bodied, pillowy, smooth and moderately carbonated.		Don't go into this expecting a ginger beer (despite its name) as it has little in common with that spicy soft drink. This is a wonderful session ale though, and worth seeking out if you are a fan of light yet flavorful lagers. Would obviously go perfectly with sushi."
10,Caldera Ginger Beer,52159,1075,4.7,Herbed / Spiced Beer,4,5,4,4,5,1283154365,MadeInOregon,"OK, so the only reason I bought this while shopping at Whole Foods was because I've never had a ""ginger beer"" unless it was ginger ALE...and we all know that's not the kind of ""beer"" we're interested in on this site! I was very excited to try this one!...		When poured out it looks like a cheapo macro lager at first sight, then the slowly fading head suggests otherwise. The body is crystal clear and is a very light straw color. The head is bright white and slowly dissipates, but is initially quite thick.		Smell is adjuncty, but there are slight notes of honey and some kind of herby thing going on...ginger perhaps? Can't really tell. From the smell there is obviously something different about this beer though. It has a unique spicy smell to it and reminds me a lot of basil, not ginger. I really can't quite place everything that I smell, but it is a very nice aroma. Superb fragrance for this beer, though definitely not a ""ginger beer"" based on the smell.		The taste is very unique also. It's kind of like a spiced pilsner or kolsch but the ""spice"" is kind of hard to identify. It does not taste like ginger. This beer actually reminds me a lot of Bison's Honey Basil ale. There is some definite astringent burn in the upper throat after swallowing that is no doubt from the ginger, but that is the only ginger I can detect with any certainty. It is only slightly hoppy and malty.		This a very enjoyable, very drinkable beer (I could easily drink 2 22oz'ers) but I think it's failing in its claim to be a ""ginger"" beer because I don't smell it, can barely taste it, and can only really detect the ginger's physiological effects of a warm throat and stomach. So, rating this one is hard; I've never had a ginger beer so I don't really know what one ought to taste like...but then again I can't really tell if I'm tasting ginger here or the combination of other things. So confused. My recommendation to you Caldera folks: ADD MORE GINGER! There's obviously enough of a curiosity about this style to not hurt sales if it was strengthened. I for one could handle it."
11,Caldera Ginger Beer,52159,1075,4.7,Herbed / Spiced Beer,4,4,3.5,4,4,1277557990,rawthar,"Notes from 6/24		A: Bright golden glowing beer in a moment of clarity with a lively white head of feathery fluff		S: The ginger is definitely there, or am I smelling my Indian dinner? Almost cake-like in its malt aroma, sharply bready with a slight edge of sweetness		T: Nice clear malty throat taste, reminds me of strands of complex sugars and grains, ginger is more subtle than I expected, more of an undertone than a backbone		M: A refreshing light beer feel, like a pilsner or summer ale		D: If this was a sixer instead of a double-deuce, I could see this being a fine picnic pounder		Overall, pretty impressed for the particular style"
12,Caldera Ginger Beer,52159,1075,4.7,Herbed / Spiced Beer,3,4.5,2.5,3,4,1275779250,Halcyondays,"22 oz. bomber,		A: Pours a clear yellow with a mild white head, good retention.		S: Great nose of ginger, honey, perfume.		T: Rather light upfront, it reminds me of Lawnmower, with a hint of ale fruitiness/Kolsch-like almost. Good ginger honey notes on the back end, not taking over the beer in any way. The ginger flavour is clear, but I wanted it to come out a little more in the end.		M: Very light-bodied, watery, light base beer for sure.		D: An easy drinking spiced beer, this will offend no one, but there's not a complexity to this brew at all."
13,Caldera Ginger Beer,52159,1075,4.7,Herbed / Spiced Beer,3,4,3,4,3.5,1273109020,RangerClegg,"Is it possible for a bottle to be a novelty product? I bought it cause it's the only bottle of Caldera I've ever seen, so I guess so. Stoked to be the first to review a beer! That's a lot of responsibility so I might as well give it a thorough review. Poured into my New Belgium Tulip.		A - Clear golden color with a bright white 1"" head that slowly fades to a ring around the top. Lacing is minimal, but still there and fighting to cling to the glass		S - Smell is of ginger and honey. Very appealing.		T - First hit is of ginger. Not too strong or biting but just the right amount. Fades to a sweetness on the tongue that is sort of perfect and then... a little bit of bite from the hops making their presence known.		M - Medium bodied and full. A nice round beer for the summer. Not too heavy, definately not watery. Not very good at describing it other than it's good.		D - I really like this beer and I could probably put 2 or 3 glasses away, so one bomber is enough for me. I think 2 bombers would be too much, but I could probably drink one and half, so I think I'll have to stick with the one.		Overall this is a pretty good ginger beer. I think that for my money though, I'd rather buy Trade Route's Ginger Pale Ale. If you've never had a ginger beer, Pick it up."
14,Caldera Oatmeal Stout,10789,1075,7.2,Oatmeal Stout,2.5,3,3,3,3,1316025612,Beerandraiderfan,"Brown in color, somewhere between a porter and a brown ale. Lacking in aroma, but no off stuff. 		Same with the taste, lacking flavor, complexity, just went with smoothness. No off flavors though, so I can't say this is bad, just unadventurous, especially for Caldera, whom I think is generally underrated. You really have to search to pull anything out of this in terms of the usual chocolate/coffee flavors, really, the only thing I can tell is that the oats did their job, because this is smooth and unoffensive.		Other than that, extremely pedestrian."
15,Caldera Oatmeal Stout,10789,1075,7.2,Oatmeal Stout,2.5,1.5,2.5,2,2,1103502339,RedDiamond,"Caldera presents yet another circumstance where the brewery does not operate a brewpub, doesnt bottle their beers, and is located 300 miles from my home. To review their beers I traveled to their hometown of Ashland, OR and drank at the Ashland Creek Bar and Grill. This may have been a mistake. 			Though I had other reasons to visit Ashland, its disappointing (to say the least) to travel 300 miles and be served a spoiled beer. Both the Oatmeal Stout and Ashland Amber were of poor quality at the Ashland Creek Bar and Grill. In the case of the Oatmeal Stout, a nice measure of cream and a wayward thread of mint were marred by a sulfuric smell and likely bacterial infection. Though I cant say for certain, my best guess is that the house tap lines were something other than sanitized. 			I will attempt to revisit and re-evaluate this beer. But for the time being, its important to ask a pertinent question about quality control. Caldera is a 10 bbl microbrewery in a small town. How much responsibility do they have towards assuring that taps serving their product in their hometown are kept reasonably clean and free of bacterial encroachment? My answer to this question is that the brewery does have some responsibility to assure quality pours in its own hometown. This is especially so when they operate no pub of their own. Not only does this effort protect the consumer from being served a spoiled beer, but the enforcement of quality control measures at the point of consumption simply makes good business sense. 			Till then, theres nothing I really care say about this beer other than to wish whoever pursues it greater luck than I had at Ashland Creek."
16,Caldera OBF 15,12386,1075,5.6,American Pale Lager,4,3,4,4,4,1062311123,beerguy101,"More of a 'dry' than a lager, tasted at the 2002 Oregon Brewers Festival. Orange color, orange flavor in nose. Light malts and fairly aggressively hopped; yet it is not very bitter. Interesting taste, complex and subtle. Light yet flavorful. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. Nice beer. Would be a great beer to sip during a hot summer day."
17,Rauch Ür Bock,58046,1075,7.4,Rauchbier,3,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,1325478004,UCLABrewN84,"Pours a murky light brown with a 1 inch fizzy tan head that settles to a film on the top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip back into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of smoked meat, smoked cheese, campfire smoke, etc. Taste is of smoked meat/cheese, campfire smoke, wood, and a slight cocoa/coffee flavor on the finish. The aftertaste is also cocoa/coffee with just a hint of the smoke flavors. This beer has a crisp level of carbonation with a bubbly mouthfeel. Overall this is a very good rauchbier from Caldera that has a bit of a different flavor than German rauchbiers."
18,Rauch Ür Bock,58046,1075,7.4,Rauchbier,4,4,3,4,4,1325360812,zaphodchak,"Faint sudsy head with some with some dissipating fine surface. Light ruddy brown. Some lace.		Smokiness in the nose along with pickling vinegar (faint), and some slightly musty malt.		Plenty of bitter, slightly tangy, tannic beech smoke. Traces of sweet toffee on the finish.		Feel is standard, smooth, but went flat quite fast."
19,Rauch Ür Bock,58046,1075,7.4,Rauchbier,4,4.5,3.5,4,4,1322506304,Tilley4,"A new arrival to the West TN area... 		Pours quite a bit lighter than I was expecting. Almost like a brown ale? Good head retention though...		Smoky bacon aromas upfront mesh with a sweet maltiness... This is definitely very smoky but not overpoweringly so... Its subtle at times and powerful at others on the nose... Like being in a smokehouse after the meat has already been removed... Very interesting...		Sweet caramel malts surprise me as I thought the smoke would hit hard right off the bat... The smokiness here is beautifully done... Not a smoke bomb but rather the smoked meat flavors run parallel to the sweetness darting in and out, here and there...		Very good example from Caldera here. Excellent use of the smoke with its subtleties..."
20,Rauch Ür Bock,58046,1075,7.4,Rauchbier,4.5,5,4,4.5,4.5,1320494397,mikedrinksbeer2,"Sampled 10/30/11 - Transferring the notes.		A ruby pour with a half finger, off white head. Opaque. Smells like bacon it's so smoky. Very much a wood smoked scent, great on an autumn night. The flavor is full but not overbearing, smoky with a hint of sweetness. I dig this a lot, will seek out other rauchbiers for some comparison."
21,Rauch Ür Bock,58046,1075,7.4,Rauchbier,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,1320140421,dbmernin83,"This is my first rauchbier. 	Pours a burnt amber. Good head.	Holy smoked meat! This has huge beef jerky on the nose. Salty smoked meat goodness.	Tastes about the same as it the nose. Wood, smoked meat, cured meat, soy sauce. 	This is delicious for the first 6-8oz, then it gets to be a little much. I imagine after having this a few times, you appreciate the flavors more. Maybe I should've picked a tamer rauchbier to be my first"
22,Rauch Ür Bock,58046,1075,7.4,Rauchbier,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,1319847514,titosupertramp,"A: Pours a rich, ruby color, clear. Maybe a finger of off-white head. Thin cap with thick ring of bubbles around the edge of the glass. Light lacing.		S: Wow. Smoked meat balanced by caramel, bready sweetness. I wish they would make this smell into a cologne..no shit, I'd wear it to special occasions. 		T: Taste is equally as good. Smoked meat with just a hint of peet. The nice thing about this beer is the smoked characteristics don't overpower the rest of the beer. The caramel, bready malts hold up nicely and there seems to a slightly hoppy finish. 		M: A little on the light side, but it's still manages to be somewhat creamy. 		O: I had heard some good things about this beer and it certainly lived up to my expectations. It's a very well crafted beer where the smoke asserts itself, but doesn't drown out everything else. I'll pick this up again without a doubt."
23,Rauch Ür Bock,58046,1075,7.4,Rauchbier,3.5,5,3.5,5,5,1318802642,optimator13,"Pours a mahogany color, rich, with a tan head. a finger, didn't stick around. 		Holy smokes! This is one of the most smokiest beer I've ever had! BUT. It's balance and not one sided. Smoke, cured bacon, rich caramel malts. More smoke. Ok, maybe it one sided, but it's heavenly. 		Rich caramel malts and salty cured bacon strips. Bacon lover right here, so, I don't feel the need to go on. 		Lighter, but medium in body. feels fine. Nothing tremendous.		Aroma and flavor alone are mouthwatering. Bravo. More please!!!"
24,Rauch Ür Bock,58046,1075,7.4,Rauchbier,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,1318290101,Blakaeris,"Pours light caramel brown with reddish highlights. The crisp white head doesn't hang around long, but quickly dissipates to a thin ring.		Aroma is intense meaty smokyness. Underneath is a mild malty sweetness.		Taste is really interesting. The smoked meat quality is retained, but there is also a generous earthy, woody character. Caramel and toffee really round things out. Finishes with a mildly dry cedar character.		Mouthfeel is a chewy, medium body.		A flavorful brew. Strong smokiness is tempered by the rich caramel malt qualities. A real winner that could bring the non-smoke lover around."
25,Rauch Ür Bock,58046,1075,7.4,Rauchbier,4,5,4,4,4.5,1318289482,bashiba,"Poured a slightly cloudy deep amber/red color with a thin soap ring of head.		The smell is amazing, big bacony smoked pork Rauch goodness.		The taste follows the flavors nicely with a big smoked malt flavor with a nice bit of underlying sweetness, very pork like and very flavorful. Has a nice light bitterness in the finish that helps even it out very well.		The mouthfeel is very slick and oily.		Great Rauchbier!"
26,Rauch Ür Bock,58046,1075,7.4,Rauchbier,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,1316405909,Klym,"Big thanks to N2168 for knocking this off my wants. Poured into a stone nonic and shared with my buddy Ryan. 		This was quite delicious. The pour made it seem a little lacking in carbonation, and while indeed it was light in carbonation I think it would have been awkward if it had been heavier considering the taste profile. This beer does such a good job of hitting the sweet and savory side of smoke. Nice big campfire smoke smell and taste without any roughness to it, with a nice smoked bacon savory sweetness. This is easy to drink and just downright delicious, would love to have a keg of this by my desk."
27,Rauch Ür Bock,58046,1075,7.4,Rauchbier,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,1315696563,flexabull,"On tap last night at the Caldera Tap House.		Pours a bright and clear brown color, with a small white head.		Aromas are quite potent. Lots of interesting smoke notes here, smoked meat, charred wood, like a camp out in a glass. Very nice.		Flavor is like the nose, but toned down just a bit. Light caramel, bready, and slightly sweet up front. Beer then settles Into a smoke house flavor, hints of charred wood, and jerky.		Mouthfeel is good, full, smooth, but not heavy at all.		Overall, this is a really well made smoked lager. The nose is wonderfull. But the beer turns out to be plenty drinkable, I usually am a one and done with smoked beers, not this one. Another great offering from Caldera."
28,Rauch Ür Bock,58046,1075,7.4,Rauchbier,4,4.5,4,5,5,1315014054,Bung,"22 oz. Think I picked this up in Chicago Binny's Oak Park.	Solid amber/brown pour, half finger of off white head disappated to a ring, but lasted.		Smoked malt, peat, canadian bacon and some malty caramel. Starting out real well.		Taste, solid dose of smoked ham, bacon, peat and a woodiness. Caramelly malt body is there, almost some faint raisin or apple cider, then finishes with solid bbq.	The real deal, far far and away the best American version I've had of this style. So few try this style, even less accomplish the task.		Lighter side of medium bodied. Coats well, goes down smooth, no alcohol. 7.4 is a little larger than some for the style, but it doesn't show itself.		Best brew I've had in a while. First I've had from this brewery, if their others are even close to as good as this I won't be disapointed."
29,Rauch Ür Bock,58046,1075,7.4,Rauchbier,4.5,4,4,4,4,1314752229,oberon,"Poured into a 1/2 liter stein a deep rich amber/bronze with a fluffy one finger head that took its time fading.Sweet smoke,brown,sugar,a bit of alcohol in the nose,mellow and sweetish,I found it appetizing.Cherry wood sweetness and light peppery spice in the nose,its gentle sweet smoke instead of in your face,mellow but assertive enough.A real nice smoked bock beer,I will grab a few of these this fall while eating alot of smoked meat off my smoker."
30,Rauch Ür Bock,58046,1075,7.4,Rauchbier,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,1312403394,t420o,"A- Semi aggressive pour produces a 1-1/2 finger very light brown head that rests atop a beautiful deep copper colored beer with nice clarity. Nicve lacing.		S- Very similar to a smoked porter but more smoke. The smoke smell is beautiful. It smells like a campfire and the cherry wood is definitely present. Excellent smelling beer. 		T- WOW! They were not kidding on the bottle when they said it has an intense smoke flavor. It is excellent and I could see some folks that the smoke is too in-your-face, but I love smoked beers and I love this one. This is as smoked wood forward as I've ever had. It's pretty much smoky wood, a slight malt sweetness, and finishes woody and smokey again. This is a perfect fall beer. 		M- Nice smooth mouthfeel with good carbonation. 		O- Not too complex because of the intense smoke taste but it works excellent in this beer. I will definitely be picking this up again."
31,Rauch Ür Bock,58046,1075,7.4,Rauchbier,4,4,4,4,4,1312162337,DarthKostrizer,"Look: Burnt orange in color with 1/4 inch head and no retention but did have some lacing		Smell: This beer smells like a campfire in a bottle also reminds me of burnt oak chips or smoked salmon		Taste: The flavor is this beer is quite unique. The smokiness is there in abundance and is pretty much just liquid smoke. Again the taste does follow suite with the noise there is a big smoked salmon flavor		Mouthfeel: Medium body and medium carbonation		Overall: If you love the idea of smoked anything actually you will love this beer. It is hands down one of the most smoky beers I have had to the point where it almost looses balance like say Alaskan smoked porter or Ass kisser smoked porter. However if you are into smoked beers this one is a must try"

No retention obviously. 		Holy shit. Smells exactly like uncooked applewood smoked bacon and/or smoked salmon(not fishy). Very nice yet strong smoke. 		Tastes just like it smells. Very strong different smoky flavor but Good. 		Good carbonation. Smooth and Medium bodied.		Overall at some point in trying this beer You Will Say Holy Shit! It is Unlike any any beer I've had and any smoked beer for that matter. Its very interesting but Good. Although it very hard to drink alot of it. Definitely a bottleshare."

Holy cherry wood campfire smoke! This smelled just like you were out in the woods.		Whoa, I could only take a small sip at first, massive liquid smoke feeling in the mouthfeel. Ugh. Its not so much as 'bad' as opposed to 'challenging'. I must admit, I could not even finish a taster of it. This is the most intense smoked beer I've ever come across, by far. I mean, beer geek bacon was a walk in the park compared to this. 		I could smell it all day. As far as drinking it, I'm cool with 1oz at a time, its that intense. If you like smoked beers, then check this out. If not, stay away. I kind of like them, trying to get into them more, so I'd try it again next time, but for now, I'm not worthy."
34,Rauch Ür Bock,58046,1075,7.4,Rauchbier,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,1309310508,TheWhiskerReview,"Pours a brilliant black with ruby tones and a 1-finger tan head. Weak retention and lace, as expected from such a malty brew.		The nose is a smoky, malty blast of barbequed pulled pork, woodsmoke and brown sugar with undertones of baked apples and peaches. Nothing over-the-top here- good balance and elegance in the aromas. And I dunno if it's just me and my mental associations, but I could swear I smelled the BBQ sauce in this too.		The palate, much like the nose, is hugely smoky- more bbq and toffee flavors- with a medium-body and a slight creaminess from the malt. The hoppiness is mild while the smoke, naturally, is what lingers on the nice finish.		A wonderful effort overall. I wouldn't go so far as to say world class, but the brew does have a nice bit of elegance which always gets more points from me. And the smokiness carries a lot of power without being too heavy."

I'll leave it at that and hope I don't O.D. off this 22 ounce bottle. On to the beer:		The chestnut colored body is a looker in the stange glass. On top, the head has a beige color, a somewhat creamy texture, several groupings of lace sticking around and retention. The rauch part is done extremely well; mouth-watering jerkied meats stand out above with a little sweetness and a kiss of leafy hop. 		There's a lot of meat on the bones of this beer. Loads and loads and maltiness and medium smokiness make this a winner. The two run in sperate stages and never cross into each other's territory, which in this case I adore. Its got the smokiness that I would find in a summer sausage. On the malty side, there's loads of caramel. Little notes of ash give me the impression that I'm at a campfire. Hints of brown sugar. Alcohol slowly gets noticed, but in a good way; here it brings notes of raisin. There is a moderate hoppiness that can be sensed for a brief second, catch it before the smoke and malt beat it down. On the fuller side in terms of mouthfeel, quite smooth with the bubbles very small yet enough to be felt. 		If I hadn't stuffed myself with Chinese food earlier in the night, I may have been more tempted to overdose on Rauch Ur Bock. Only kidding, I have a good idea when to stop. Warning, you may be temped buy more bottles after you try your first. In short, superb."

A: Clear, dark amber color with one finger of diminishing off-white foam head. Light lacing remains on the glass.		S: Sweet woodsmoke is intense, developing fruity and savory complexity that distinguishes itself above the Bavarian archetypes.

Smoke nearly persists throughout, but diminishes by the clean, short finish.		M: Thin to medium viscosity, wet on the palate but becoming a bit too insubstantial, with moderate carbonation.		D/O: This Oregon-brewed rauchbeer develops some of the most intense woodsmoke essence encountered thus far, but it may be at the expense of the strong lager that is its base. Deciphels of the imports from Bamberg would find this beer's intensity surprising--if not off-putting--but it does struggle to leave any impression other than aggressively pungent woodsmoke."

It's not as crisp or dry as other Rachbiers, and it seems a bit more full-bodied, with almost a touch of syrupiness to it. which is kind of an interesting take on it. I'm digging it. 		I'm not usually one to say this, but it's almost a touch malt-forward. Not that it's a bad thing. I think this is probably my favorite domestically produced Rauchbier I've had the pleasure of tasting. It really hits on all cylinders.

Nice glow to it though.		Smell is smokey and sweet. Both cherry and beechwood were used, but I'm getting mostly cherry in the nose. 		Taste is really quite smokey, the beechwood really asserting itself here, although the sweetness of the cherry wood and the malt is no slouch either. The smoke has a sharp phenolic quality that I get from peat, but with the sweetness I think it works well. Note it's not cloying, the sweetness is enjoyable and provides relative balance. 		Mouthfeel is slick, some softness, a medium bodied, and smooth. Nice. 		Drinkability is really quite good for such a smoke bomb. No doubt inspired by Aecht Schlenkerla, with the body and color of the marzen, but the punch of the ur bock, it one of the best stateside examples of the style, which is rarely attempted and even more rarely successful. I have to say, this was really good, and with just a touch less phenols, would be up a notch easily."

Aromas of smoked kielba, and dark roasted malts. 		This beer was OK but for a style that I like so much it did'nt really please as much as I thought it would. It had a nice amount of smokiness to it.

Wow this is the mother load of smoked dominance. Nothing subtle about this liquid smoke bomb. Concentrated ash and dried aromatic kindling. Damp Tobacco just adds to the one sided affair. If I had to reach for some balance there is a faint raisin type sweetness buried in the finish. 		Notes: I'd be interested to see exactly how they brewed this beer. The smoke seems more of an extract additive than natural smoke. A bit much for me. However, a 12oz bottle would have been more appealing for one sitting and it has nothing to do with the moderate ABV. Its a rich SOB."

We have liquid bacon in a glass here! Although initially the cured meat taste is so intense I can't look past it, I was finally able to pick on its other dynamics half way through the bomber. Sweet stone fruits and a touch of orange zest add their nuances to the flavor. Its more complex than I usually find smoked beers to be and I can really enjoy it!		Semi-thin in body with fine prickly carbonation is a nice contrast to such a powerful flavor profile. Anything heavier may have been too much. Finishes clean.

Melanoidin drenched smoked dark brown sugar laden bready malt aromatics. Simple but absolutely entrancing - takes hold of your reptile brain like bacon.		Sweet fruity malty palate entry suffused with delicate layers of smoke. I can't quite tease apart the beechwood and cherry, but the latter adds a bright complexity to the darker tones of the beechwood (which is more standard for this style I believe).

Yeah, the smoke is big but not over the top ... Dry and almost ashy. Malt stands tall with tones of toasted bread, treacle, dried grass. Mild hopping goes a tad herbal in the finish, a little red in the cheeks from the alcohol. Smokiness lingers far into the after taste.		So smoky, so tasty ...

S + T: I thoroughly enjoy a good rauch, and this one performs quite well in the traditional 'ham and cheese sandwich' sense. It's not overly smoky, which is a positive thing in that it allows some of the other delicate scents and flavours to shine. Of those, I pick up on a light - but noticeable - fruitiness, both in nose and on the palate that seems a little odd. 		worth note: after writing the above, I noticed the print on the side of the bottle to see that cherry wood is used in addition to beechwood. That would explain the fruitiness noted. 		M + D: Body feels a little lighter in the mouthfeel, but seems to pick up a little weight after going down, however little sense that might make. The alcohol content is perhaps a little high, but a little slower sipping never hurt anyone.

Other flavors include sweet dark malt, brown sugar, a bit of cinnamon and leather. Quite nice and well blended. The body is medium with a mouthfeel that seems a bit sticky, but is pretty good.

Earthy and slightly piney with bitter sappy sugar.. The bittering is not high, but there is little aroma hopping evident or much malt complexity either. This is a very light pale ale with little going on beyond some bittering hops, leaving a slightly floral but vegetal finish. An okay beer for a local brewpub, but not quite up to the standard of most pale ales in distribution. Light bodied, creamy, lots of smooth bubbles.		A simple beer, but not really in a good way.

S: Plenty of hops in this one with above-average pale malt backbone with leafy and grapefruit aromas dominating.		T: The flavor is good but a touch flat for the style, owing mainly to the lack of character in the maltload.

Solid and highly bitter for the style and could use a little more finesse. Still, enjoyable and didn't last long."

Pours a startling straw yellow with a smallish head that falls to nice lacing. The aroma is the strong point - assertively grainy with a crisp hop aroma, mostly grassy with a little flower. I really looked forward to tasting this beer. But it was weaker than I might have hoped, with less of a malt backbone that the aroma suggested and more emphasis on the flowery side of hop character. The bitterness rests, curiously, mostly on the foretaste, with relatively little clinging to the back. The mouthfeel is quite thin, almost insubstantial.		This is a decent beer, but nothing to get excited about."

Light and very, very crispy feel is exciting and spot-on for the style. crisp with a creamy smooth finish from the beastie foam still clumping it's way down slow.

See-thru deep gold body with a finger's worth of creamy off-white head. Pretty good retention and lacing.		Fairly strong citrusy hop bouquet with a pleasant mild sweetness and biscuity malt. Smells like it will be a crisp, dry brew.		And so it proves to be. There's a bit of honeyish sweetness up front, but it's immediately bullied around by a tag team of citrus (orange zest and grapefruit) and sharp pine needle flavors. There's a bit of earthiness in there, too. 		The sweetness dries up torward the finish as the citrus is joined by some pine needles for a sharp sting of bitterness and a rather 'scratchy' mouthfeel. After a couple of seconds, the bitterness is chased away by a crisp snap of biscuity malt. Carbonation is lively, and the beer starts off as seemingly medium-bodied, but 'fluffs up' in to something pretty substantial. 		Overall impression: Excellent APA.

This is a nice brew. The flavor is present & accounted for without being overwhelming.

Poured into a traditional American pint glass that came chilled, so I had to give it a chance to warm and wipe it down.		Appearance: Pours a surprisingly light and transparent golden yellow - I'm hesitant to say urine, but, you know - with an initially foamy two-finger head that fades into a relatively healthy sheen pretty quickly and leaves lots of scraggly, fluffy, cloud-like lacing streaming upwards towards the rim. The collar if thick and fluffy, though light looking. A solid start.		Aroma: Buttery, slightly spicy malt notes, cracker and biscuit-like, with a few light fruity esters - perhaps hoppy in origin, perhaps yeasty in origin, coming across as pineapple in places - mingling with some heavier, definitively hoppy citrus notes, and plenty of grassy, spicy notes. Perfectly pleasant.		Taste: Very balanced for a pale ale, almost ESB like. The malt profile here is large and in charge, very graham cracker/biscuit like, perhaps slightly buttery in places. Malt bitterness is mild to perhaps moderate, slightly herbal and grassy, lacking a lot of those good west coast hop notes that I'd like out of, well, a west coast hopped ale. It's almost cinnamony in places, probably a result of the hop notes. Odd but interesting.		Mouthfeel: Incredibly smooth and soft, gently carbonated, leading to a very creamy and subtle mouthfeel, a feel which works well with the malt profile on this one. Very very nice.		Drinkability: This was a strange and somewhat unexpected brew. Not quite your traditional west coast pale ale, heavy on the bitterness, citrus, and minty hops with a heavily roasted but still sweet malt backbone to back it up; this one is more heavy on lighter, spicier, grassy hop notes and has a surprisingly light and dry malt foundation. Nonetheless, it's still nice, pleasant, and went well with the first six minutes of SuperBowl XLIII!"

Pours a pale yellow color, slight opaqueness, good sized head with a little retention layer and a little bit of lacing.		Smell is stronger than I would expect from a pale ale, strong citrus and grapefruit aroma with hops, makes me think it could almost be an IPA if some more hops were added.		Taste hits with the hops and citrus first, leaves an interesting bitterness in the mouth, not quite good but not quite bad, carbonation is just right and it goes down crisp and smooth, I could see this being an easily sessionable brew if it was available in Maine."

Poured a slightly bronzy gold color with two fingers (and I have big fingers) of creamy white foam. The head stuck around for a while, and left lots of streaks, spots and ""globules"" (as Nigel Tufnel might say) on the sides of the glass.		Piney hops and mildly sweet, caramel-ish malts make up the nose. Seems like Caldera's taking a west coast approach to the style.		Not as hoppy in the taste as I would have thought in the smell, but not to an underwhelming degree. Piney hop flavor melds with caramel malts. The balance is pretty good, with the hops winning out, but not enough to make it an IPA. Mildly dry at the swallow.		Medium bodied, with a slightly slick mouthfeel.		Not a world beater, but a pretty good example of an American pale ale.

Very nice floral hop aroma. Lots of cascade with the underlying citrus aroma. Nice little caramel malt aroma but it is definitely hop dominant. 		Golden but cloudy.

At first glance this beer is a bit lighter than Dale's but remains a very good looking beverage, pouring a slightly hazed golden color with a large white head that lasts a while and leaves very impressive lacing. 		Nose is very hoppy and bitter, quite a bit of citrus noticeable. More sweet and less toasted malt than the Dale's. I'd have a hard time deciding on a favorite between the appearance and aroma, but very slightly prefer the taste I had yesterday - both probably should rate about a 4.25. Caldera is more bitter - that isn't a bad thing - and has a noticeably dryer finish. 	Body is on the light side of medium - seems slightly thinner than Dale's - while carbonation is crisp and appropriate. 	Final verdict? Another extremely drinkable brew, and another fantastic canned beer for my forays to the pool or wherever glass isn't allowed/convenient."

I noticed no oxidation whatsoever. It poured a just-slightly-hazy golden body beneath a short head of frothy white foam. The head dwindled down to a creamy surface covering, and then shrank away to a wide collar and whispy surface covering; leaving behind tiny-spotted walls of lace. Bright hops, sweetish malt, and yeasty fruitiness greeted me in the nose, expressing soft citrus, sweetish grainy malt, berries, and cut-grass. It's soft carbonation and medium-light body left it remarkably smooth across the palate. The flavor delivered a rich maltiness upfront that wasn't quite caramelish or toasty, but headed there; followed by an influx of grassy and citrusy hop flavors; and then some berry-like fruitiness at the swallow. The bitterness roses up strong, and although some sticky malt lingered in the mouth, it was bitter, dry, grassy and spicy in the finish. It lingered momentarily with some strength, and then faded to a dull bitterness, leaving me ready for another sip. Quite the little charmer, I say! I love the flavor transition from quaint, sweetish, straight-forward and non-caramelish maltiness, to bold, grassy, citrusy, and bitter hops!!! The apple-ish and berry-like fruitiness is just the icing on the cake that ties the two together. Well-balanced with a very nice complexity and full character, and still not overdone. Worth trying!"

Decent hop bitterness, but not a very distinctive hop character. Lacks the roundness of some of the better pales.	Mouth is decent, pretty light with some brightness, but with enough body.

The attractive, cream colored head looks to be high in hop oils; at least I hope so. The glass residue is so fine and spider web-like that it resembles actual lace. Drinking this beer out of the can and missing an appearance like this should be a criminal offense.		The nose is outstanding (see 'drinking... can... criminal offense' above) and puts a huge number of IPAs to shame. The pithy pungency of the Cascade hops fairly leaps out of the glass, with the overall aroma made deeper and more interesting by a much lesser quantity of spicy Perle hops. Great job Caldera. Even if the flavor is on the pedestrian side, the nose is a world-class sprinter.		The flavor doesn't measure up to those stratospheric heights, but that's not to say this isn't a deliciously hoppy pale ale. Emphasis on hoppy. The brewers made sure their beer would last a good, long while by packaging it in light-rejecting aluminum and by adding an impressive amount of hops. Sweet, spicy and juicy white grapefruit is front, center and back. I love the slight variation on the usual Pacific NW flavor profile that the German hops provide.		APAs don't need to be complex to suit me (this one isn't), they just need to be bursting with pale malt-supported bitter hoppiness (this one is). There's enough sweetness on hand to keep things kinda, sorta balanced from a hophead's perspective, although the pucker factor is still decidedly high. The mouthfeel is light-medium and perfectly carbonated; the better to down a few cans on a hot summer day without a second thought.		Caldera Brewing Company is anything but a household name (unless one lives in Ashland, Oregon or its environs), but this little brewery has just provided me with the best beer that I've ever had out of a can.

Classic citrusy hop aroma springs ahead in the nose with a biscuity and slight caramel malt playing supporting roles. 		Upfront citrus hops with a bready malt in the middle.

An expected deep golden to light copper color does the beer pour. Froathy head character amounts to an inch or so before settling it's white lace on the glass. Good retention, but great on lacing. A classic Pale Ale appearance.		Caramel, spice, and hops blend in the nose for the impression of graham crackers, orange rinds, and a touch of ginger. Very appealing aroma that doesn't let the hops nor the malt gain precidence.		Sweet maltiness sets the tone for taste with a medium caramel flavor, cracker-like breadiness, and a light grainy or crusty taste that gives a slight bite that ushers in the hop flavor and bitterness. Grapefruit, orange zest, and light grassy notes peak through early, but grow in intensity until the malt sweetness waivers, giving the finish and aftertaste a decidedly bitter ending to an otherwise balanced beer.		Malt sweetness gives a fuller, rounder sensation to the mouth, while the hops and moderate alcohol provide a drying and crispening finish. Though not complete in dryness or crispness in finish, the beer holds onto enough malt character to attempt balance deep in the finish and aftertaste.		With relatively low/no flaws in execution, the recipe formulation leads to a somewhat one-dimentional caramel malt sweetness that wears on the palate and hurts the sessionability of the beer. And with the standard malt/hop balance, there's not much intrigue to keep me comming back."

Sweet malts come forward after a few whiffs, slightly bready...		Decently hoppy for an APA, a lot of them just fall short in this category unfortunately. Overall sweet, juicy citrus hops are prevalent. Sweet, honey-like malt flavors come forward after the initial citrus hop taste fades, with some earthy dry hops quickly washing the sweetness away...		Medium bodied with good carbonation, smooth, a lingering bitter drying finish...		Pretty good, I love APA's out of a can...would like to try this again knowing for certain that it is fresh. Why can't breweries date their beers???!!! Frustrating!"

Appearance- Pours a brilliant deep straw color with faded hints of pale orange. Big, rocky eggshell white head rises and clings to the glass with each sip leaving an absolutely beautiful lacing behind.		Aroma- Bright hop aromas of grapefruit, pithy orange peel, and slightly pungent pine. Healthy burnt sugar and sweet malty undertones with a whisper of mineral-like yeastiness. 		Flavor- Nice balance from start through the middle and into the finish with soft caramel/burnt sugar maltiness and a hearty pungent citrusy vein of hop goodness. Bitterness and hop pungency intensifies into finish and lingers well beyond the exhale with a kiss of cracker-like light malt. Very refreshing, crisp, and edgy pale ale! 		Mouthfeel- Light to medium bodied, low-moderate residual sugars, moderate CO2. Nice balance, but definitely some sticky hoppiness to this brew. Refreshing with an edgy, pungent, minerally dryness in finish. 		Overall- This is ridiculously drinkable and just about everything you would want in a pale ale! Big hops, but nice dose of flavor, aroma, and bitterness in there. Just the right amount of malt sweetness to keep drinkability high. This would make an excellent lawnmower beer, but still has enough complexity/flavor to be a great pair with food- I'm thinking pulled pork and slaw, or anything spicy. I'll definitely grab more of this tasty nugget in a can!"

I was assured by the proprietor that this was fresh.		Looks wonderful in my pint glass. Serious 2 finger head that sticks around and around. When it does subside, a beautiful lace is left behind. The beer is orange with some gold highlights. Agitation brings it back at full force. A great start.		Smell is average, unfortunately. Some citrus hops and some pale malt. But not as pronounced a boquet as I would ask for. What's there is orange, sweet marmelade on biscuits, and caramel.		Taste is also just not cutting it. Looking at my experience rating APA's, I've had several that just pack more flavor and in more creative ways. Great Lakes Burning River and Three Floyds Alpha King blow this away. However this is decent. My biggest issue is that the citrus-backed bitterness and the sweet kiss of honey and bread crust from the malt just fall short of anything more than the average. 		Mouthfeel is above average thanks to the adequate, smooth carbonation and medium body. Finish is wonderful with just a touch of lingering bitterness. Very drinkable as well, I'd like to try it from the source sometime to see what's it's like when maximum freshness is assured.

179,Caldera Pale Ale,25414,1075,5.5,American Pale Ale (APA),4,3.5,5,4,5,1280377901,ThreeWiseMen,"Poured into a 7oz. snifter.		Appearance: Poured out quite nicely: produced one finger's worth of fluffy, off-white head, which came to rest atop a crystal clear, golden body. Faint streams of carbonation did their best to keep that head up, but it eventually faded to a sticky crown. Bubblebath-like lacing trailed the beer all the way to the bottom of the glass. Nice.		Smell: Pineapple + cat pee = Simcoe. Those are the two aromas I got right off the bat. Pine bark, wholegrain toast, and lime also pulled through. If I could guess, I'd say the hop bill includes late additions of Simcoe and Amarillo hops. Not bad, but not what I typically prefer in a pale either.		Taste: Whole grains, butter and dough form a lovely malt backbone. Lemon zest accents that backbone, while woody hops create a bold, bitter aftertaste. Not sure how old this can is, but I love the malt-hop balance, which is tilted just a bit toward the malty end of the spectrum.		Mouthfeel: Caldera Pale Ale's active yet soft, rolling carbonation massaged my palate for the entire session. The body is light, crisp, and very refreshing. To top things off, the beer finishes bitter but not too dry, and leaves a flavorful, long-lasting aftertaste. It don't get any better than this. Perfect!		Drinkability: The more I drink this, the more it reminds me of New Belgium's Ranger IPA (in a pale ale form, of course). I didn't expect a whole lot out of this one going in, but I finished it in a flash! Will definitely buy more if I come across it again."

The more craft beers that come in cans, the more the stigma that surrounds canned beer will fade away--plus, there is no debate about sunlight and bottle color. That dead horse has been beaten way too much.		Thin tiny-bubbled lace forms from a moderate pour, retention is fine and the lace stays around for most of the session. Brilliant golden color shimmers in the light. Flowery citric hop aroma screams Cascade hops, bit of biscuity malt with a mild caramel sweetness in the nose. Light to medium body with just as much smoothness and crispness, both with ample amounts for the semislick mouthfeel. Minty and earthy yet mainly citric-flavored hop draws in a lot of flavor with a solid bitterness. Very clean palate with bread notes, almost grassy graininess in the middle. Hop bitterness digs in deep but does not go too far to throw anything out of balance. Cascade hops are all over the finish with an earthy citric flavor. Ends with a touch of dry maltiness.		A benchmark ale for PNW Pale Ales, if not American Pale Ales altogether, and that benchmark is not of modest stature. It shows great balance without the Cascade smack taking over, clean and very drinkable. The last of the sample was paired with a plain goat cheese and Pink Lady apples--very nice."

My first brew from Caldera, there seems to be a kind of obsession with the number 60 on the can that I'm not ""getting"".		It pours a clear light golden colour, good 2 finger head of foam, looks to have some good lacing.		The smell is big citrus hops and an equally big nose of grain, not so good, and some honey, which is nice. Ok, now the grain surpasses the hops and everything else and I'm saying what? I have mixed feelings on the smell, which, don't get me wrong, isn't bad, it ends up being good. 		The taste is a battle between the hoppy bitterness which is, really, a nice light citrus combined with some pine, and a strong grainy flavour that for me, seems out of place for an APA. Hell yes, I like a good malty presence in the style but I'd rather have some sweet caramel taste to balance the hops than an all out frontal attack of grain and grain is what is distracting me. To no good end. Dang.		On the high end of light bodied, lowish level of carbo. The mouthfeel is just fine.		Drinkability? I've noticed after further sipping that the combination of the hops and grain make for an undesirable, to me, bitterness in the finish so...I'm glad this is only 12oz. I'm not fond of this but I'd like to take a stab at Caldera's other offerings. I never judge a brewery based on a one and only beer I've had from them. ;^)"

T- Caldera Pale Ale is a winner, A great balance between hops and malt with a little edge on the former.

Nice pleasant hop flavor on the medium bodied, lightly toasty malt spine. The hop flavor's character reminds me of some Lagunitas beers with their blend of herbal, grassy, and tropical fruit flavors. This is moderately hoppy, appropriate for a pale ale.		I guess this could be a recovering hop-head's session beer.

After a seemingly steady diet there for a while of AmeriCAN macro lagers, it is nice to see and smell something decent glug-glug-glugging its way out of the CAN and into my glass. 		I caught two fingers' worth of rocky, bone-white head with decent retention that was already beginning to leave a nice lace in its wake, following my pour. Color was a slightly-hazy honey-yellow. Remember, kids, clarity is overrated! Nose was grapefruit-citrusy. Pale Ale, bah! In many of our Central-Southern states, this would have been their IPA. I began to weep at the thought of previous recent CANs like Lone Star and Stack - rubbish in a CAN! Recovering, I took a sip and got a mouthful of full-on Cascade hops! Zounds! Yoi and double yoi! If this was simply their Pale Ale, it struck me as to why I loved their IPA in a CAN so much. I may have found a new favorite brewery for CANs... I allowed myself to luxuriate a little more fully in the second sip. It was very citrusy on the palate and even a little grainy, as though the liquid were saturated by hops. No matter, because on the swallow, it was so dry that I could not help but reach for another sip. More, please, sir."

Aroma:	There is not a whole lot of aroma but can smell a slight hint of citrusy hops.		Mouthfeel:	It has that dry astringent taste that some wines or teas leave behind.

217,Caldera Pale Ale,25414,1075,5.5,American Pale Ale (APA),4,4,4,4,4.5,1254099708,RoyalT,"Appearance - This is a light and bright orange in color with a modest head that showed great retention.		Smell - This is an even combination of nice grain and fruit-juicy hops. The citrus hops are very intense and at first appear to be overtaking the nose but then the grain proves to be a bit more stubborn. Together they form a fair balance and a beautiful APA bouquet.		Taste - The hops are more forward at the taste but the grain holds its own. It's easy to wax on about the hops because they are big and exceptional, but I'm going to talk about the grain here a bit. They are light for sure but show a sharpness not often found in the style. This IMO allows the hops to stand out without being overbearing.		Mouthfeel - This is bigger than a light lager but not medium-bodied. There's a bitterness here that is somewhat mild but forceful in that it finds its way throughout the mouth from beginning to end.		Drinkability - I was very impressed with this Caldera can. The style usually is not one to stand out but this effort is an exception."

The bitterness is prominent and subsides gradually into a light toasted note like baked biscuits which is well blended under layers of bitter tasting spicy pepper and pine. The flavor has a mild citrus pinch in the finish w/ more rind taste than flesh of fruit. The bread crumb-like malt taste is trailing w/ dry leafiness and mild alcohol as it finishes		D - A bitter pale mainly to put it lightly, more like a light IPA.

S= Slight coffee roastiness mixed with treacle-like sweetness combine to make a rich aroma.		T= Extremely tasty porter here. Started off as a battle between slightly bitter roasted malts and the sweetness of the caramel malts. Some earthiness and dark fruit esters creep in to add complexity midway.

This is a great neighborhood bar, with a fine, if not huge selection of beer, and deserves some spillover beer geek traffic once the Clinton Street Theater's brewpub opens down the street. Anyway, the porter is lighter than your typical porter black, more of a transparent ginger brown. The head is small but the lacing is determined. The aroma is mild rainy day, and the flavor profile contains deep caramel, light smokiness, cured meat, cola, and a tart herbal quality that masks the malt sweetness. It is not an exceptional beer but it satisfies and provides a lighter counterpoint to Caldera's rich coffee/Cauldron stouts."

The taste of the beer had some sweet notes up front with the fruits and brown sugars that might be in there. The finish was a little on the dry and spicy side. The mouthfeel I thought was just a little thin. Overall the beer was worth the try for sure. I would probably buy this one again in the fututre."

Very light head tops a thin effervescent surface. Taste is belgian yet bitter, with very little of the promised oranges. I'm getting a lot of roast out of this, which normally would be a compliment but it just doesn't fit what I was expecting. Aside from the bitter notes the beer is pretty good, it's almost like a belgian strong dark coffee stout ale."
246,Vas Deferens Ale,58920,1075,8.1,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,4,3,4,3.5,4,1309227572,Nashvillain,"This beer is an awesome color, a very dark brown that only lets small amounts of light through around the edges. Head is thin and fleeting, the small amount that sticks around is like cream poured in a latte. Smell is a light belgian roastiness, something like a sweetness mixed with coffee and a slight amount of bread. It's very faint, hard to pull out any specific aromas.		Taste is great, a roasty brown ale with a belgian-friendly slant. The yeast lightens up the beer considerably, very thin up front with most of the body in the middle and finish. The sweetness hits first, followed by the roasty flavors and orange bitters in the back end. Nothing in the beer is really overpowering, but it's not weak, just tame. On the whole, it seems like there's a tendency to go crazy in the BSDA category, this is a reserved offering that's great for a nice relaxing evening, definitely in opposition to what the label may suggest."

Appropriate color for a BSDA. The good looking lid of golden khaki is not Belgianesque... nor was it expected to be. Thick streamers of sudsy lace means no real negatives.		I'm not getting much in the way of Belgian yeast esters in the nose, which makes me think the brewers used dark candi sugar, but not Belgian yeast, and called it a day. Not getting the blood orange zest either, just some dark malts.		Vas Deferens Ale is the first Caldera brew that I haven't enjoyed immensely. While it isn't bad beer, it's a sorry excuse for a BSDA no matter how you slice it. The flavor profile does not fit the style, not least because there still isn't much contribution from the yeast... which is what should be driving this car.		Specifics include toasted pumpernickel, medium-dark fruit, black tea, black pepper and a modicum of citrus zest. That last one isn't immediately recognizable as orange, blood or otherwise. Warming brings a bit more boldness and definition, which is enough to tilt the score in an upward direction. Good sweet-bitter balance and skilled alcohol masking help too.		Since nothing else about this brew is Belgianesque, it would unfair to ask the mouthfeel to be. It has neither the medium-full creaminess, the expansiveness, nor the hang-on that it needs to earn the 4.0.		Unless you have a passing familiarity with human anatomy and physiology, it's probably best that you don't know what the singing devil on the rather disturbing label is being showered with. Hey Caldera, in the interests of gender equality, how about giving us Fallopian Tube Flanders Red Ale next?"

LOL ... we're OK now. It's a dark and heady brew. Brown sugar, medicinal phenols, bubble gum and ripe fruit make for a Belgian-like aroma. It is crisp and smooth with a bitty mouth- feel. Suggestions of chocolate, oranges, toasted bread and rum come to mind. With modest hops, the alcohol is very prevalent; lots of ripe tropical fruit in tow. Bitter orange wins over the blood orange zest. This beer is not half bad, and certainly worth a try if you can get past the label."

The beer pours an extremely dark brown with a foamy, light 2"" head. The beer has smells of alcohol, citrus, and heavy malts, but all well blended together. The beer has a robust burst of flavors, again well blended like the smell. There are flavors of malt, sweetness, citrus/orange, and a little bit of molasses undertone. It's impressive that these bold flavors all blend so well, and the beer still manages to be smooth in mouth. There is an alcohol tinge to the flavor, and it is rather pleasant along with the rest of the beer. There is a very smooth finish, as well, and the beer is surprisingly easy to drink despite all the strong flavors and the decent ABV. Pretty decent brew, and it's unfortunate that this is a rare release. I think this could be a decent flagship beer for the brewery. If it weren't for the sticker price, I would bring home a lot of this one."

It smells of oranges, chocolate, nutty malts and it strangely smells a bit like cherries.		It tastes strongly of oranges. The orange flavor almost has a fresh taste to it. The malt taste to the beer is a bit nutty and chocolate like. There is a noticeable amount of Belgian yeast flavor. I get a tangy almost chalky flavor from the yeast. The yeast also seems to add some fruity characteristic to the beer. This most orange tasting beer I have ever had. They must have added a lot of orange zest to the beer.		The carbonation is medium low in this beer. It has a smooth carbonation to it.		The drinkability is pretty good for the how high it is in alcohol.

It's seems to be amply carbonated, but the small head quickly dissipates leaving little lacing.		The nose is a little flat. Given the description on the bottle, I was expecting something unique and layered, but I could have mistaken this for Newcastle (sorry NC fans). You can pick up a bit of the orange, but given that the label mentions orange was added, you're smelling for it.		The flavors are a bit more pronounced than the scent, but they're perhaps less interesting. You're met with roasted malts and orange, but the flavors don't pop, at all, and they're combined with muddy, earthy tones that becomes cloyingly sweet as the sip progresses. This beer needs something else. Hops, perhaps? Perhaps not, it's simply unbalanced.		Given the wispy head, I wasn't expecting a lot of viscosity and I wasn't surprised. This is light on the tongue and not in a good way, especially for an 8% Belgian. I've noticed some 'chewy' references here - maybe I got a bad bottle? Possibly, but I'm not sure bad batches/bottles change the body much, and this is pretty damn thin for 8%		This beer clearly doesn't work and it's not something I would seek out again, but it doesn't fail - it's not the worst thing I've tried and I like what they were trying to do here.

Deep roasted malts and hint of coffee up front followed by a rich chocolatiness in the finish; just a hint of alcohol esters in there as well. A few more sips reveals a little toffee and some dark fruits; alcohol becomes more prevalent as the beer warms but doesn't detract from the flavor or drinkability. Mouthfeel is smooth, rich, and surprisingly, dangerously drinkable."

The smoky aspects of this set this one apart from others of the style and have me hooked... There's also a big hop presence to this that has me thinking chocolate covered orange or something of that nature..

Old Growth in the Duvel tulip appears black in color with a firm inch of tan/khaki colored foam that is dense and leaves some spots, great retention.

Smell is big on the caramel, honey, sweeter for a stout, but clearly one nevertheless.

Taste is big, loads of complexity of this one, all the adjuncts combine with the chocolate and roast flavors of the malt to remind me of a really fancy truffle. I particularly enjoyed the lingering taste of the pink peppercorns. For so much complexity from the adjuncts, none of them are over done. Smooth, clean,well executed and exceptionally good. 		Mouthfeel is slick, medium-light bodied, surprisingly, but not in a thin way, just not thick and heavy.		Drinkability is good, this is a really nice RIS, super unique.

S: Malty sweet nose of fudgy chocolate, mild vanilla, candied fruit and a vague woodiness. Intriguing floral aroma, perfumed with lavender.		T: Big chocolate and an astringent coffee roast hit right upfront; sweeter notes of vanilla, even maple syrup, follow. Lots of grain, mild fruit (say, earthy blackberries?), and a fair amount of piney woodiness. LOVE the spiced honey flavor!		M: Lots of grit and grain fill the mouth, stick on the teeth.

I knew Old Growth was an imperial stout, but I wasn't aware it was brewed with licorice, honey, chocolate, lavender, and pink pepper corns. So when I drew the snifter to my nose and inhaled its essence, I was caught off guard by its peculiar tapestry of fragrances. I kept wondering if the beer wanted to smell and taste as it did, or if bad luck was conspiring against it. I concluded that Old Growth suffered from no unintended intrusions, but I was still perplexed by its uncommon design.			I found Old Growth on tap at the Fort George Public House in Astoria where it was featured among other notables as part of Stout Month. Fort George was serving it in 12-oz. snifters where its panoply of sharp aromas was ably focused. Chocolate flavor was featured abundantly, yet the fragrance was also enhanced by a spice mix suggesting mint. The taste worked parallel to this and I was convinced I was drinking a chocolate mint elixir - pure girl scout cookie. 			Old Growth's body is oily black with sepia froth. Its complexity makes it an anomaly in a snifter but a year of aging at least tempers this with some smoother contours. I came to enjoy it, but it's clearly not for everyone. 10.3% ABV."

The aroma was very bright and fresh cascade hops, behind which lay a few fruity esters. 	The taste was really nice, my kinda of hoppy beer. Sure, there was a bitter backbone on the finish, but only as much as necessary to keep it balanced. This was all about the citrus and floral notes of the finishing/dry hops, nicely complimented by lots of stone fruit, particularly apricot. The malt, like the bittering hops, only served to keep the sweetness and check and relatively balanced. This is the hoppy NW brew I'd been waiting for, and I'm glad found it! 	The mouthfeel was medium light bodied with lively carbonation. 	The drinkability of this was very high for me. I had two over dinner, it went well with steamed clams, raw oysters and steelhead.

When I took the first sip, I realized that what this should have been called is ""hopjuice"". The taste is the supreme incarnation of Cascade hop aroma stripped off of the bitterness.

Just as word about this beer reached me before I could drink it, so too, the fine aromatic fragrance of bright floral hops leapt out at me from the glass before I could take a sip. Its not surprising that a dry hopped beer should carry such a resounding hop fragrance. Still, the vitality of the aroma was compelling. And the hops were not limited to a mere fragrance.

The aroma is sweet, non-descript malt with just a touch of grassy hops and some graininess. The flavor is quite similar with pale malt sweetness, some grassy herbal hops, clean yeast, grainy notes and a surprising amount of bitterness. I have to say that the flavor is pretty disappointing, even for this style, though the dryness does give it some merit. Mouthfeel is not just light, but watery.

A- A clear pale straw yellow, very clear and clean. Very little head but then again most beers of this style don't have much head so in comparison to the style it is good. 		S- This has your typical lager yeast smell. There is a bready, earthy, grainy and gritty smell. Very rounded and bold smells in terms of beer of this style.		T- The beer is crisp and refreshing. I'm getting a big grain taste that is like chewing on the top of a barley stalk. More like the smell of when a grain truck dumps its freshly harvested barley load into the grain grate to be weighed and priced, take that smell and put it as a taste and that's what I'm getting. There is a subtle sweet honey taste that is coming though and adds a nice level of flavor. There is actually a nice complexity going on with this beer, especially when you are comparing it to other beers of the style. 		M- Good mouthfeel, nice carbination and a very light body.		D- Easy to drink, the name of the beer fits very well. I would drink this after working out in the yard no prob. This is clean but not BMC clean. It's more like clean but in a dirty glass type clean. 		Lagers are not my favorite styles of beer. But one thing I've found is that the flavors are more subtle then other styles. Many craft lagers get a bad wrap because of BMC lagers and how many people are so against them here on BA. I rated this beer based on its style, and for its style it is very well done and tasty. I would definitely buy this one again."

Still prefer Full Sail Session beer for mowing lawns but if Caldera were to can this beer I would drink some on a hot day by the pool or mowing the yard. I like the fact that it is 3.9% abv. Good beer for such a low alcohol content. Really a ""light lager"". And in that category it is a winner. I paid $3.09 for a bomber which is too expensive for lawnmower beer.

As my buddy whom this bomber was shared with put it, ""One time I puked up a bunch of Cheetos, this smells like that...""- While I agree this was very displeasing, I was able to pick out a few herbal notes. This reminded me of a crappy floral tea. I got the rose petal here and there, but it wasn't in a nice delicate aroma; it was more in your face and mixed with DMS.		T/M- Not very good. I tried to give this a chance but I couldn't find what they were going for on this. It is all malt with no hops presented in any way, shape, or form. I wonder if they 100% replaced the hops with rose petals? Thats what it somewhat tastes like; though the rose petals still aren't prominent or pleasing to the palate. There just wasn't any saving grace to this beer; it's a shame.		O- I hate to say it, but this was a drainpour by both of us that shared the bomber. We tried, I think I did more than he; but in the end neither could stand to go on.

Luckily, I happened to have a bottle of rose water around so I took a sniff of it and I just couldn't make the connection. The beer as a blonde ale is really very solid. The pale malts work wonderfully with the carbo to create an extremely refreshing beer. This would have been nice to have during those 95+ dog days of summer .		Overall, it is a solid beer.

Pouring a firm amber color and with brilliant clarity, the beer carries an impressive foamy off-white head, retains well, and laces even better. A quentessential IPA look, but even a mild haze would have been alright.		Caramel richness and piney, grassy, citrusy scents swirl for a somewhat succulent but pungent and sharp hop scents adorn the rim for a balanced and inviting aroma.		Flavors of sun kissed barley malt, deep caramels (almost toffee) and bread crust give a much richer malt contribution to flavor than I'm used to in an IPA. But the hop allow for a zesty flavor of grapefruit, orange zest, fresh cut grass, and spruce that are signature IPA flavors. With no off flavors, esters and phenols to a minimum the beer is well brewed- but the malty rich recipe gives me reason to ponder.		Sweetness in taste result in a creamier and richer body. Creaminess early lingers well into the mid palate and finish before the hops and alcohol force a terse dryness very very late.		A very good beer but the caramel sweetness makes the beer attempt balance where IPA's should be the showcase for hop flavor, aroma, and bitterness. Maltiness also interferes with the body and hinders the crisp and dry attributes needed for greatness in the style."

Smell is strong; piney hops w/ citric notes and touch of spice and a sturdy malt base of caramel and some roasted malt as well. Smooth medium body, borderline creamy, with a great citric hop bite and minor sharp carbonation for a cutting beer. Balanced with minor sweet caramel and some roasted/toasted/dry malt feel so you get that pleasure of both citric notes (w/ a touch of pepper or coriander taste) and some sticky sweetness. A real dry, hearty finish lets you know you are drinking a well-balanced and made IPA and while not the greatest beer ever it is rock solid for an IPA w/ that wet, grassy, almost veg like feeling IPAs from the northwest have. A must try for anyone."

It smells piney and earthy and gains in the taste. Earthy Munich malts balance with a lot of citrusy and herbal northwestern hops, with some metallic and peppery notes sneaking in to make a solid but not outstanding IPA. Slight stickiness to the mouthfeel, but very drinkable overall."

The aroma is very hop forward, notes of citrus. Everything good about the nose gets ramped up a notch in the taste. Huge grapefruit and orange flavors, good malt backbone and a really nice hop finish. Medium bodied, carbonation is good. An incredibly drinkable IPA, will definately seek out again!"

The head settles to a scattered cloudy sky. 		Nose: Crackery caramel, herbal hops, citrus tones		Full bodied and slick thick. Huge malt profile sweetens with rich deep caramel, toast, and biscuit. Generous hopping give citrus rinds and herbal grasses followed by a brutal drying biting bitterness. The malts and hops battle all the way throughout the lingering finish. Nicely balanced and full flavored.		Seems more like a DIPA to me, hard to believe that the thick malt backbone only came out at 6.1ABV. Quality IPA in a can, gotta love it!"

It sat atop the cloudy caramel/orange body for a good amount of time before sinking. It left an excellent wall of lace, topping it all off.		The nose had a good complex hop aroma, just a tad short on intensity. Hints of pineapple, fresh tomato vines, fresh grass, and a dash of astringency and metallic twang make up the one-sided hop aroma.		The flavor is excellent. It takes what the nose started and cranks it up a notch. Passion fruit sweetness meets a bold herbal grassy profile, and the two work together great. Malt knows its roll.... the shy pale toasty backbone. The finish is bone dry with grassy bitterness. 		This one is pretty dry right from the get-go. The carbonation is perfect and keeps it feeling on the light and crisp side. My mouth needs the constant reinforcement of another drink. Great IPA, out of a can!"

A - Pours a strong slightly hazy copper color with some nice orange hints. There is a nice soapy and sticky head on this one that is nice and white and is about 1 inch tall.		S - Delicious grassy hop notes up front. Some cannabis and some nice citrus notes are perceived. There is some nice biscuit malt in the nose as well but mostly it is a delicious grassy and grapefruit hop nose. 		T & M - starts off with some nice bready malt that is then quickly followed by some nice citric and grassy/spicy hop notes. Wow. This is delicious and it comes form a can. Im disappointed I hadn't had this before since it is readily available in St. Louis. It has some nice grapefruit hop hints mixed in with the bready malt. It also has some nice tangerine notes that are citric and sweet at the same time. The body is nice and light with some crispness and a great clean and dry bitter finish.

This beer ranges in color from golden at the bottom of the glass, to ruby/amber at the top. There's a nice pillowy, khaki one-finger head that recedes at a snail's pace. Great lacing clings to the edges of the glass. Some moderate carbonation is visible in the glass.		Smell: Citrus and pine hop aroma is offset by some sweeter fruit scents and nice caramel malt presence. I'm also getting a touch of bready influence.		Taste: The hops are pretty unrelenting in this one. The malt holds its own though, and breaks through the bitterness a bit at the end. There is actually a touch of sugary sweetness just as the bitterness wears off. The influence is brief and barely finds its way through the hops, but it is a nice counterpoint to the bitter onslaught.		Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied and extremely well balanced. The hops are strong enough to state their case, but subdued enough to let the other flavors have their turn.		Drinkability: A very solid, session-beer contender. I love the can too!"

I drank them all out of the can so I can't really go into any detail on the beer's appearance, so i just averaged it with the rest of the critique.		A: I'm sure it was good.		S: Sweet and grassy with a bit of malt, but the hops really dominate which is nice.		T: Nice grassy kinda piney hop bight right off the bat with some grapefruit flavor in there too, then mellows a bit which allows the maltiness to come through at the end.		M: Medium bodied but on the lighter side of medium, mellow carbonation but not under-carbonated by any means, someone used sticky to describe the mouthfeel and that's a real good way to describe it.

On to the beer:		It's all good in looks; dense head, iron orange color in my glass, good retention. The nose is the expected NW IPA dose of lychee, grapefruit, and pine sap. As suggested the nose, this IPA goes towards the ""dirty hop"" side. Big smack of grapefruit, pine, lingering hop bitterness on the palate, and a hint of orange. The aftertaste of sap lingers softly.

Appearance - Deep amber orange, completely translucent, not sediment or haze at all. Pours with a very frothy slightly off white 2 finger head that dissipates to about 1 finger and leaves a nice lacing all the way around the glass.		Smell - The smell has some great pine and citrus qualities from the hops. A very rustic and earthy scent can be found. There are hints of grapefruit and a bit of orange rind. Great presence of the biscuity malt and some caramel sweetness.		Taste - Not a lot of that pine and rustic earth come through on the taste but you do get some good bitterness in the form of citrus and the biscuity sweet malt comes out nicely on the end with a surge of fruity grapefruit and orange. All of that is followed by a nice bitter finish. I love the fruity sweetness followed by that bitterness.		Mouthfeel - This seems a bit watery for my liking, and a bit light too, it doesn't take away from the beer too much though luckily, still great. The carbonation seems pretty good, maybe a bit overcarbonated.		Drinkability - This one has good drinkability, nothing amazing, I could definitely drink a few cans. The 6 pack may be an issue but I'd attempt it. 		Great IPA, in a can no less."

Pours lightly hazy orange amber with a good two finger foamy white head that leaves some foamy rings of lacing and holds a light foamy cap. 		Aroma features a good deal of citrus, mostly orange/tangerine alongside some papaya, mango, melon, grapefruit, also a lot of pine, a little floral and grassy, a little sweet bready malt. Good strength. 		Flavor is able to retain some of the citrus fruitiness of the nose, but not all, more resinous hops on the tongue, pine, floral, and a fair bit of sweet bready malt, kinda surprised by the level of sweetness here for an IPA but does help keep it balanced. Fair bitterness on the finish but the sweetness sticks around as well. 		Mouthfeel is medium bodied, oily and sticky, medium carbonation. 		Very glad to finally try this and it is an excellent well-balanced IPA. The nose is by far my favorite aspect...very nice.

Swirling brings back a decent layer, though ultimately retention is thin. Good amount of lacing.		Floral aromas around the edges are interwoven with hints of pine. Citrus is worked in too, with notes of grapefruit pith, lemon zest & maybe a spot of orange or tangerine. Not a whole lot of predominant malts, just a little sugar cookie sweetness.		The hop profile is very clean. Quite tasty without exhibiting lots of bitterness. The nose seems to be a good indicator, as there's a tendency toward floral & mild pine notes upfront; moderately dense citrus notes are more notable in the middle. Tangerine, lemon & grapefruit fill it out nicely. Faintest of toasty malt in the back; honestly, it's negligible. Maybe a hint of caramel.		Medium-light body gets a little heavier as it warms. Rather low carbonation, but it works for this beer, allowing for expressive flavors. Mild bitterness lingers on the finish.		Very enjoyable from start to finish.

Caramel malt flavor is very prominent. First few sips are mostly bitter, but as I keep tasting it, the malt is coming through more and more. Very rich malt flavor with the pine and citrus notes balancing it perfectly. Flavor is much more complex than I was anticipating.		M - Medium bodied, very good carbonation. Not as oily as most IPAs.

A nice looking amber/gold hue to the body with some little rising bubbles. An impressive looking two finger width pillowy off-white head has great retention and lacing. The clarity is excellent. I can't imagine improving the look of this beer.		Smells like a nice piney/citrus combination of hops with a rather strong malt backbone of caramel and butterscotch. I smell some juniper bushes in this one too. A little bit of earthiness and some spice on the tail end.		A beautiful caramel begins at the front of my tongue, followed up by some butter rum lifesavers and sweet bready malt. Seems pretty malty, but then the hops liven up the party with a healthy dose of pine, grapefruit, raw bitterness and earth. Finishes clean and peppery, with a slightly alcoholic finish.		Loving the mouthfeel on this beer. It's got a perfect medium consistency with a nice head texture, perfect carbonation, and the right finish.		This is a very balanced IPA, but it's still pretty big and bold. I enjoyed this a lot more than Caldera's Pale Ale. It's not a terribly refreshing IPA, but it was a pleasure to drink, and delivered exactly what I was looking for. Overall, a strong example of the classic American IPA style."

Pours clear, bright copper, dark enough that it ventures almost into ruby hues in the wider sections of the glass. Head is huge, towering at at least 3 fingers of dense off-white goodness, and taking a good while to settle back down. Tons and tons of delicate lacing covering the walls of the glass as the head recedes.		Nose comes through as direct but very well done - big grapefruity citrus hops sit on top of a light bed of toasty caramel, really well put together and refined. 		Taste is very, very good. World class even. Grapefruity hops come through big to start, though this one is all flavor and almost no bitterness - hopbursted? - with a firm layer underneath of toasty caramel malt that is just in absolute perfect balance for an IPA. The hops are clearly the star of the show, but the malt is just dialed in to perfection. Wow. Finish starts with a big juicy-sweet grapefruit burst, and carries a very manageable bitterness that never builds out of control as the finish dries right up.		Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, medium-full bodied, maybe just a tiny bit sticky. Really exceptionally done. 		Drinkability is startlingly good, up there with my best IPA experiences. A really top-tier IPA that I'd heard a lot about, but really wasn't expecting to be as good as it is. Tip of the hat to the folks at Caldera, beautifully done beer."

A thick mat of nearly-white head collapses to a still-impressive thin, but dense cap on top of a clear copper body.		Bright, citric hops like fresh lime zest and juicy orange with just a touch of pine. Plenty of malt character too with a solid dose of warm, toasted Munich malt. Caramel is there too but it just smooths out the edges of the beer and softens the blow of the supposed 90+ IBUs. Speaking of which, this IPA drinks more like a 60 IBU beer thanks to the malt support, which can be good or bad depending on your hoppy beer imbibing preferences. I, personally, like my IPAs both ways. More balanced seems to work well for a beer only pushing 6% ABV.		A great beer in a can. Not such a rarity these days, but still nice to see. The only detractor is the $11/sixer price, which makes it hard for this to compete with some of the bigger hop-happy brewers like Sierra Nevada."

A: Deep orange-amber, about as dark as you'll see an IPA. Thick, creamy 1/2 head doesn't go away. Excellent lacing. Rising bubbles. 		S: Standout. Powerful citrus and pine overwhelm the nose. I could smell this beer all day. 		T: Doesn't quite live up to the smell, but starts out strong and only improves as it warms. Hop bitterness is there but doesn't interfere in the least with the gorgeous grapefruit and pine flavors.		M: A slightly dry, bitter finish is the only downpoint here. While it's in the mouth, this baby is heaven.		D: As I said, this is about as eminently drinkable as a 50+ IBU, 6.1% ABV can get.

T= Again the pine, but the grapefruit shows up stronger then the nose suggests. The hops are out front, but not the least bit aggresive. A touch of malt in the backbone evens things out and holds the hops in check.		M= Light bodied. Smooth and a bit creamy for an IPA. Carbonation is light. The bitterness of the hops linger, but in a more subdued way than other IPAs I have tried.		D= This is an IPA I could drink all day. Not too filling, not too bitter, well balanced."

A really great canned IPA for the pool /beach or really anywhere. I also like Avery IPA, and Modus in cans, but I would have to give this brew a leg up on either, a little more fruit and hops than the others and at 6.1 ABV really drinkable. Not terribly bitter either, so it would makea great IPA for anyone who wants to step up ftom PA's to IPA's.		Also found the last sixer in Myrtle Beach on the shelf, and what a great surprise. Not only the only the only canned IPA available but a damn tasty one, Drank it out of the can so I have no idea on what it looked like, smelled like or any kinda head retention, but I loved it. I also had some Modus, but Caldera was definitely a little more fruity. IMO a real find, and a real solid A kinda brew. Would have scored higher if not being guzzled at the beach which knocked down the appearance and nose, Drink ability is good but the ABV in the killer heat had to be respected although not a heavyweight in this dept"

Beautiful, brilliantly clear coppery orange beer with a thick cap of ivory bubbles that lasts throughout the whole drink. Wonderful sticky lacing. Nose is full of strong citrus hops, with grapefruit and orange the leading flavors. Note, as the beer warms, a mild diacetyl butteriness becomes noticeable. Very hopforward, with a nice malt backbone. Citrus hops pack a punch throughout, with some big bitterness and some resiny characteristics on the finish. Medium mouthfeel, with a resiny finish that mildly detracts from the brew. Overall a very drinkable hop bomb, a true big northwest IPA."

Good taste, not tongue numbing hops or bitterness, just the right amount for an active outdoor lifestyle for this ipa. Right amount of sweetness. Not heavy on the palate at all. Good summer ipa. Nothing outlandish mouthfeel wise. $10 a 6 was difficult at first, but seems to be a decent price after all."

Pours an amber orange color with a creamy one fingered head. The foam dies down gradually but keeps an even layer on top. Moderate amount of carbonation.		S - All I'm getting is delicate citrus, bisquit, and caramel. Not overly aromatic for an IPA and I'm having an unusually hard time picking up any other nuances.		T - Light caramel biscuity malt, with a little bit of sugary sweetness at the front of the tongue. The tongue is greeted with caramel malt and almost immediately after is hit with the citrus hopping to keep the sweetness in perfect check. There's a caramel-like grapefruit bitterness left in the mouth and eventually, nothing but grapefruit bitterness after the sweetness dies down.		M - Slightly on the heavier side of medium bodied, smooth feel as it rolls over the tongue with the carbonation being more on the creamy side than prickly.		D - Very, very good. 		Very finely balanced. I din't like it at first so I waited to have a second can on a different day to give it a fair chance. I have to say it's growing on me. At 6.1%, I could drink these all day, a nice change up from the high octane beers."

Poured the beer into a 'Hoegaarden' Grand Cru glass.		looked good, huge cream coloured head sat on top of a dull, hazy, dark amber/orange body. The head produced some heavy lacing and tried to stay throughout the tasting.		The nose was of yeasts and hops along with some grain type esters.		The hops from the aroma take over the taste completely, a real bitterness hits the mouth and throat. Why do they (or is it you?) have to over hop everything in the US when they brew an IPA? There really is no need to do so. It isn't as bad (hop wise) as some I've reviewed, but still too hoppy for my tender tastebuds.		It is true to the American IPA style and I think one of the better examples I've had (I am not a huge fan of the style though)."

405,Caldera IPA,10784,1075,6.1,American IPA,4,4,4,4,4,1278462382,BeerAdvocate,"Beer review from BA Mag Oct 2007.		Hooray! for canned craft beer. We really love this format and how quickly it is spreading throughout the US. Options are great, especially when you are in no glass zones such as poolside, on a boat, on the beach--and also simply for the fact that the can is a great space saver. 		Stodgy off-white head, the sticky mass shows its great retention as it stays strong all the way down to the bottom of the glass. Clear copper-penny hue; a few bubbles race to the top. Citric, pine and black tea hop aroma. Hint of melon, estery alcohol and sweet toasted malt in the background. Lots of smoothness to go around--extremely smooth. Slightly chewy medium body shows the malt is not just going to sit back while getting pummeled by the hops. Mild cookie-like sweetness from the malt has a faint toasted graininess to it. Hops come in with a controlled but precise bitterness, strong but still leaving some balance. Big minty hop flavor very slowly dissipates with citric rind, evergreen, black tea leaves and a sweet Mandarin orange flavor. Finishes a little bittersweet with a rock-solid hop flavor and sweet biscuity maltiness. 		This is a great example if you are looking to try a Pacific Northwest (PNW) India Pale Ale. Hops all around, both in bitterness and flavor, with enough malt to keep everything in balance. Nothing over the top. It's simply a great IPA--and it's in a can."

Aroma is hops, floral and citrusy, with a nice roasted/toasted malt backbone.

It starts with light malt, a tad toasted with a noticeable hop bitterness, this transitions into a brighter, more hop focused flavor.

Malt character is mild, but there are hints of caramel, toast, and dried fruit in the backround. It's a very balanced beer.		M & D: Medium bodied and full of flavor.

The eggshell head is real fluffy and big. Retention is excellent, leaving a thick sheet of foam on top throughout the duration of the drink.		S: Very pungent nose; tropical fruits like pineapple and slight mango, piny resinous hops, and slight earthy undertones. Citrus (grapefruit and slight orange and lemon peel) is also apparent. Alcohol peeks through the nose a little bit, but doesn't take away from anything. Malts give a firm base and seem like they will balance nicely.		T: A little different from the nose...the 94 IBUs really shine and give off a puckering bitterness. Earthy, resinous, and citric hops make up a majority of the flavor. I don't know exactly what gives this flavor off (I have the same thing in my dry hopped IPA that was brewed a few weeks ago) but it tastes like the smell of whole hop flowers- slightly vegetal...I did dry hop with Simcoe so maybe thats where it comes from. Malts lend a caramel and toffee backing that helps to balance, but seems to be consumed by the hop bombardment. 		MF/D: Smooth and creamy feel. Pretty big body for the style. Carbonation is awesome- at the ideal level in my book. Not necessarily a complete palate killer, but close to it. This makes for a good outdoor occasion IPA.		Notes: Solid IPA. Typical of the west coast style- bitter and resinous. Great tailgate or beach beer"

Smells like im sticking my head in a barrel of fresh hops. very floral and earthy, some citrus. the hop presence in the smell of this beer is assertive and strong.		Taste gives way to fresh, juicy grapefruit and resinous pine. Extremely vibrant. Definitely hop forward, not a lot of malt to explore in this one. 		Mouthfeel is medium bodied, carbonation is nice and moderate. Has a nice flowing, juicy feel to it in the mouth, I can tell this beer is very fresh.		Highly drinkable, I'll get right down to it and say this is an excellent IPA I could drink all evening. They did a great job on this beer, i'd consider it in the class of the best IPAs I've had.	This is also my introduction to craft beer in a can, very impressed all in all."

S - Some citrus-y and evergreen hop aroma is available, but it is pretty tame.		T - The flavor is much more potent than the aroma. There is a very classic West Coast dankness that is melded at first with the rich malt, but then separates itself and stands apart, with great herbal and leafy hop flavors lingering intensely on the finish.		M - IPA. Good.		D - Not the best of the West, but pretty good."

A: Color is a dark yellow/gold, almost bordering on a pale orange. Pours with a decent (1 1/2 inch) white head. Head is dense and disippated slowly.		S: As expected, lots of hops are very noticable - citrus (grapefruit, orange), floral, pine, etc. Quite a wide range of hop flavors, actually.		T: Taste continues where smell left off - lots of hops. Good citrus, floral and piney hops are evident throughout the taste with only some minor malt flavors present. Finish is a touch bitter, with some of the hop flavors fading, leaving just some bitterness behind.		M: Medium body, moderate carbonation, finishes dry.		D: Excellent. The perfect summer picnic or camping beer. I've consumed cases of this stuff and find it a very drinkable. It is well balanced, bitterness is in check, and you can consume several of these without being overwhelmed."

New to my blighted and ""Famously Hot"" city of Columbia - the heart of Darkness of South Carolina - Caldera IPA is a welcome reminder that I once lived, nay, was even born in the Pacific Northwest.... and someday may be blessed to return.		The Caldera can itself is a rather ugly yellow with lots of hop cones around a, uh, caldera (cauldron) and the whole thing is rather an affront to the eyes, perhaps designed by a 2nd year art student who dropped out to smoke dope and lie on the beach with his rotund black lab and pierced girlfriend, but what do I know.		Caldera IPA is a dull, clear deep yellow, with a nice head that never really dies and some nice sticky lace. Smells good, but not great - pungent and resiny West-Coast-Yo hops, malt is regulated to the background. Grapefruit and some citrusy fruit, a smack of booze. Taste is similar, more hop-bitter forward, a bit thin, sweet but not terribly characterful malt. No real surprises here, but it's not bad. A fine finish, adequate carbonation and some finishing hop bitterness turn this into a pretty solid IPA.		Caldera can't quite hang with the big dogs, and at a price of $12 a six pack has to do a little more to justify itself in my mind. This is a good IPA, but the world is rife with good IPAs... I would gladly drink this anytime, but if my distributor is reading this, man, have you seen what $12 buys you on the streets of Ashland these days?"

S: Nice mix of mild citrus, pine and floral scents. Very mild malty sweet scent too.		T&M: Very well-balanced, medium bodied IPA. Mostly floral hops with a mild background of citrus and pine.

Easier to store in the fridge, lighter and really very good. Joe at Green's mentioned that it is similar to 'Two Hearted'.

Murky orange/copper poured to a half inch creamy head. Love the lacing as it disappears down my gullet...		Aroma wafting toward me reveals all the IPA scents: citrus, pine, with a hint of rising bread.		Many of the previous reviews state a syrupy consistency, and I agree it is syrupy, however, if your a DIPA lover, you won't mind it a bit. Chugs more like a DIPA which I love.	You'll get whacked up front with a nice citrus profile before a light sweet malt and lingering bitterness take over. The bitterness is just right leading you to raise your glass in another slug creating a nice drinkabillity which many IPAs do not nail.

A little hazy in color but does have a nice lively action look to it.		Nose was toned down a bit for me. More of malty caramel sweetness hits the nostrils followed with a subtle touch of grapefruit and grass.		Taste was extremely sweet at first of a heavy walloping malty gooey-ness of a backbone.

A  Orangey-rust with a fantastic fluffy cream colored head. Great head retention which hangs around for a good 10 minutes. There are two fairly prominent floaties in here; not sure if they're hops, or pieces of Oregon.		S  The aroma is a little subdued, but what I'm getting out of it, I like. Lots of really earthy pinecones and trees, orange marmalade, light grass and a fair amount of caramel dipped bread.		T  I don't see a date on the can, but I think this might be on the older side. BUT, being just over the hill doesn't stop this from being delicious. The hop profile is on the mild side, but maintains for the entire taste with fresh cut grass, lemon soda, barely bitter grapefruit and spruce. The malt that backs all of that up comes out in toasted nuts, lightly sweet caramel, hearty rye bread. There is a really nice balance going on here  while I would like the hops to stand up a little more, the malt profile is still second fiddle. But even though the malt characteristics take a backseat to the hops, the nut+caramel bread combo is fantastic.		M  No problems here  medium bodied, a touch on the syrupy side with an understated carbonation pop.		O  Easily a beer I could drink by the six pack.

Pours a pretty amber, with a good 1/4"" of off-white head - and while it dies down, I can already tell that it's going to leave a good lace. 		The nose seems somewhat muted, but I can pick up grapefruit, and a bit of pine. 		Somewhat bracing in its bitterness - significant grapefruit that really lasts. A very crisp pine flavor comes through as well. Quite hoppy, but no associated burn. 		A little viscous on the tongue, tucking into each crevasse in the mouth. Good carbonation - really leads the tongue to enjoy the hoppiness.

Lots of earthy musty spicy hops with some hop oil and fresh wet hop flavors. Some pine and grapefruit, a little more citrus, and chewy hops. Pretty bitter, or more than I expected. A slight sweet malt touch just for a little roundedness. 		M: Some spicy hops and some oils, a good body and good carbonation.		F: The bitterness builds a little on the finish, and just ramps up to a nice peak and lingers there for a bit. The musty fresh wet hop flavors, pale hops, and earthy hop flavors seem to linger for a while, with a touch of pine. A little orange peel bitterness hits as well. A nice IPA, some good hop flavors, but a little too musty and bitter, orange peel bitterness."

The aroma is good. It has a nice pale and Carapils scent along with a huge citrus hop aroma. There is a light breadiness as well. The taste is very good. It's light with a damn bitter hop taste. It's loaded with citrus goodness. The malt bill provides some balance, but this is a hop heavy beer. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a great session IPA. It refreshingly hoppy and easily drinkable."
456,Caldera IPA,10784,1075,6.1,American IPA,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,1266947297,PeteVenkman,"Tastes like a hopped grapefruit, which sounds terrible but drinks pretty nice. Citrus is not overwhelming, but it's in there. I think I prefer my citrus lean toward lemon, but this is fine. Frankly, the best reason to drink this is the vessel.

S: Blend of grapefruit, pine and floral hop bitterness. Bready malts and a light caramel underbelly.		T: Up front, there is a nice pine bitterness that transitions towards a subtle citrus tone in the finish. Bread and caramel malts are present throughout. Moderate bitterness in the finish.		M: Smooth, medium bodied. Carbonation maintained its form from the first pour. Constant roll of bubbles on the tongue. Clean, crisp finish. Slightly sweet from the malts.		D: Overall, a very nice offering. The overall hop presentation was not quite as ""fresh"" as I was expecting, but this is a good product and its nice to see it available in a can."

S: Slight, hoppy, piney aroma. 		T: Citrusy with piney hops. Crisp and not real bitter but it does have a slight bite with lasting flavor. The hops definitely comes through. A nice IPA that doesn't knock you over. Typically what an IPA is suppose to be.		M: Lightly carbonated, smooth and thin. Not watery or oily. 		D: Refreshing and while not a session beer, you can easily enjoy a couple of these without any problems. One of the better canned micro-brews that I have tried."

Plenty of frothy sticky icky lace - whitish, messy and organic like foam off the ocean. A lingering head that leaves plenty of webbed lacing down the glass.		Smells like an artists interpretation of hydroponic marijuana. Incredibly dank, backed by a tight jolt of crystalline sugar. Smells of wild fields of flora and fauna. In my head I am brought to my knees, imbibing in nature's melody. In for one more whiff... DANK! High in the nostril a hint of potently sweet floral hopiness surfaces and then disappears. Wow.		That nose is expressed well in the mouth. Starts wet and slightly sweet, attaining a Noble hop bite on the front of the tongue. Low sweet caramel notes hold things briefly in check but the hopiness only continues to grow from the front to back. In the middle a plethora of fruity notes emerge - grapefruit, lemons and oranges. In the next flash though its the earthier, piney hop that begins to shine. By it's finish the show is brutally bitter - it 'Arcs' only as it finishes. A puckering bitterness that again brings to mind the wild tastes of a forest. Hops are pooling on all sides of my mouth with pine-like bitterness. My tongue is buckling, and I'm wondering if I'm as much of a hop head as I think I am. The hops are imposing their will on my senses, and I'm starting to beg for mercy. The brewer has fortunately carbonated the hell out of this beer. The hydrophobic (read: oily) resins are minimized by all the surface area provided by these bubbles. This produces a light/medium body with a lot of texture. I am catching an alcohol heat in the back of the throat that is not totally pleasant. Drinkable, HUGE, challenging."

Nose and flavors consist of bready, caramel malt, perfume, a bit of bitter grapefruit pith, lime, lemon, lightly toasted rolls. Medium bodied with adequate carbonation. I thought this would be super fresh and hoppy since this brewery just came into PA a week or so ago. I was a bit let down, especially judging by the reviews here. Needs more hops..."

Had no option but to drink this straight from the can so I can't comment on appearance. Had a nice scent of bitter citrus and pine.

Caldera IPA boasts a kinda bright orange with some shiny bronze shades within. A clean looking beer with no haze at all. Two fingaz worth of off white foam that is quite creamy looking and condensed. A bunch of lace on the glass.		The hops take up most of the nose with a big grapefruit bite and some pale malts to back it up with a sweet scent, slight caramel. Not very bold but smells like the makings of a decent IPA.		Tropical fruit on top of a nice malty layer. Grapefruit, pineapple, others, some bisquit giving malt. I'm really liking the balance on this, it's pretty much even. Some grassy earth towards the end. This really reminds me of Lagunitas IPA.		The feel is smooth and a bit bitter, but nothing too much. Carb is just right not very high or overly crisp, I could drink this all day."

A: Standard pour yields a 1 finger fluffy white head with poor retention, leaving a rather thick, patchy white film floating at the top. Beer is a clear reddish orange. Lacing is frothy, layered, appropriate for a beer this style. 		S: Cane sugar, citrus, piney hops. Fresh but very subtle. Not an overwhelming nose by any measure. Slight sourness is also detectable. 		T: Opens very crisp, refreshing. Piney hop character presents itself towards the middle as the beer warms a bit. Citrus and cane sugar sweetness is present at the back but is overtaken quickly by an astringent, hoppy bite. Finish is a leafy bitterness, as if I've chewed	a hop nugget. Aggressive! 		M: Light bodied, good carbonation but rather smooth. Watery and very refreshing though the finish is a bit overwhelming which takes away from the feel a bit. 		D: Light bodied and crispness make this beer more drinkable than it should be. A very unbalanced IPA in my opinion which is not for me, but nevertheless appreciable. I'd reach for it if it was around, but this is a one shot deal for me. A solid beer."

S: Nice aroma of bitter, citrus hops along with a slight caramel and bready malt backbone.		T: Clean and fresh taste of bitter hops with some citrus tones and layers of a bready, caramel malt.

M: On the lighter side of medium-bodied with moderate and slick/creamy carbonation and a hint of lingering bitterness on the way down. 		D: very drinkable as it is well balanced, clean and fresh.

Appearance: Pours a pretty vibrant copper color and starts with about a 1 finger of slightly off-white head that fades to a pretty full and thick skim; body is clear and shows strong carbonation; a prety full curtain of lacing holds tight to the sides of the glass.		Smell: A lot of nice and bitter hops like a good IPA should have - tons of pine and bitter citric fruit peel. Straightforward, no questions to be asked.		Taste: I'm impressed - Caldera's Pale Ale was a real let down, but this is quite solid; lots of bitter hops right up front -- very piney and that citric fruit peel that is oh so nice and bitter and not juicy at all (not that juicy is bad either, but this one is straight up bitter); faint malt presence offers a little bit of sweetened balance, but the bitter dominates; fairly strong metallic aftertaste, but it's still really good and doesn't downplay the solid flavors too much.		Mouthfeel: Strong carbonation makes it feel very crisp and lively; body isn't thin, but not quite thick either -- about where I would like an IPA; a nice stickiness from all that hop resin coats the roof of the mouth quite nicely. 		Drinkability: Actually, I could probably drink this all day; nice solid bitter flavor with a crisp and refreshing body; would be great for a hot summer day, but I can't complain about drinking it when it's 15 degrees outside either..."

ECE/SAE amber colored liquid with three fingers of solid soapy seashell foam which recedes to a thin but persistent layer leaving agressive lacing behind resembling a mackerel sky with tiny clouds embedded in faint legs. Brilliant clarity.		While there is strong citrus in the nose (with tell-tale orange zest), the Simcoe hops seem the most pronounced of the three utilized, with their distinctive forest-floor/pine contribution. There is also an herbal borderline ""catty"" note that I didn't notice the last time I tried this beer (though since it is canned I don't think it was light-struck!).		Mint, orange pith, and pine needles on the palate with an undercurrent of pale malt. Unripe citrus bitterness with a bit of lemon/lime but no grapefruit. Finishes rather dry and faintly toasty. A little less pronounced malt that many NW IPAs - though more than most IPAs from SoCal.		Zippy, resinous, and highly carbonated - this is quite refreshing. An excellent choice for car camping or a fishing trip."

The smell is of pine, herbal spicing, some medicinal notes, perfumy, with orange and grapefruit. A nice, complex hop aroma!		The taste is of an herbal, aspirin-ish, bitterness with grapefruit and orange. Alcohol comes through in a peppery way. Slight metallic (steely) notes accompany the caramel backing. 		Medium-bodied. 		This is a nicely done, hoppy IPA, even for the style, with a solid caramel backing. Despite slight metallic/steely notes and slight show of the abv, this one disappears ""too"" quickly and is certainly worth seeking out if you're a follower of the hops!

Nice soapy lacing hat slides down the glass. 		S- Tropical fruit (pineapple) upfront along with other citrusy hops. Light bready malts in the background. Very light earthy floral hops...these could have been a little more in the aroma in my opinion. 		T- Nice bitter hop bite right off the bat which I didn't foresee.

M- Lighter mouthfeel. Good carbonation for the style. Hops left a trainwreck of bitterness on the palate. Some hop resin stuck around after each sip. Light tropical fruit in the aftertaste. 		D- Very drinkable IPA in my book. The light alcohol taste kind of brought the taste down a half point in my review but after some sips it went away.

Definitely not the familiar yellowish, golden orange of most IPAs. Large off-white head.		Smells faintly of pine, more strongly of ... well, citrus. Not quite grapefruit, just citrus-y. And there's maybe a whiff of malt. Well, maybe not.		There's a strange toasted after-taste to the malt, and the hop flavoring is a touch muted.

Nose is pretty fresh smelling CCC hops... pale malts and a very minor caramel is way in the background.

Pours a nice, slightly hazy, toasted ruby-brown color. There's visible carbonation running throughout, feeding a short, well-retained white head. There's a tremendous amount of sticky white lace that marbles the sides of the glass without any signs of fading. 		Smell is all hops - aromas of grapefruit rind and earthy, musky hops come through. There's only the slightest indication of sweetness from the malts. 		Taste definitely reflects the largely hop-forwardness of the aroma. The bitter citrus rind presence in most detectable in the aftertaste, and a hint of the piney, oily sticky hops hits the tongue early on. There is more of a malt foundation in the taste, but it is hardly sweet - more toasty, full and warm. The aftertaste is really nice; it makes me want to wait between sips to enjoy it a little more. Feel is bright and perfectly carbonated - not too much and not too little. It fills the mouth and spreads the flavors around the palate very well.		This is one highly drinkable beer. I was tempted to drink it from the can because you don't see that all that often with crafts. I went for the glass, and enjoyed every last drop. Definitely recommended for a try.

My notes for Ashland Amber included commentary on the CAN itself, including verbiage and mention of CAN-conditioning. This, however, was a visually appealing CAN with vibrant color reproduction and a green pop-tab. My buds at that stoner joint, Roots (http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/10996/?view=beerfly), would fully dig this CAN. Hey, before anybody gets their panties in a bunch, a) I kid and b) I CAN pass a urinalysis standing on my head. I dig beer, you dig? Plus, that place has a really smoky vibe and I am sure that they would not be particularly offended. Onward.		Both times, my pour has begun with a finger of ecru head which has simply sat down, leaving sticky Belgian lacing in its wake. The nose is forest hops - pine, green, earthy, sticky, massive. Sweet hops the hope of my life - once again, that damned howling monkey shut up and climbed off of my back for the moment. I am on the waiting list for hops rehab but it's a long list and I may not last that long. Thank Bob for hops! 		It now becomes a simple matter of drawing some of this delectable beverage into a syringe through a needle and jamming said needle into one of the few remaining viable veins. No heating necessary. Cold fusion is more satisfactory, anyway. Once I untie my rubber hose, the euphoric quality begins to set in. I am one with the Beeriverse. My existance is justified. I'm not just a simple Hophead. I am a HopJunkie and an unapologetic one, at that. My licking the lacing out of the glass is starting to draw stares from the nieghbors. So what?!? The heck with them! This is my scene, man, and don't mess with me while I'm digging it. Find your own scene and report back. 		Man, how do I convey veinfeel over mouthfeel? It was righteous! Full, sticky, veinous (not vinous), right on, baby! Finish was hoppy, sticky, yummy, the EMTs are trying to restart my heart, man. Zounds!		Where am I? Was this a review? Wow, man. What a groovy trip. Did you dig the scene too, or was it just me? I gotta get in the shower, man. I'll try anything once."

Shows an orange-like copper in the pint with a nice white froth. Citrus and pine hops jump out of the glass with orange, lime, dried apricot, subtle peach (I know...it's weird, but that's what I got), pine, and easy hop leaves followed by a clear caramel, biscuit, and a touch of cereal grains. On the palate, there is a medium hop bitterness that shows fron the beginning through the finish that is smooth, but a little lean and kind of weak for an IPA. Although the beer is very smooth, balanced, and easy to drink, I was looking for more of a hop presence from this beer (being that's it's a west coast style IPA). Overall, it's a solid IPA that is very easy to drink, but one that left me looking for more."

A little too malty for my liking."

M: Medium bodied, average carbonation, slightly sticky, cloying finish. maybe from the hops.		D: Decent drinkability, though I've had much more drinkable IPA's.

Tight white head forms and when it falls away leaves lacing on the glass. Carbonation is medium.		Aroma is good but pretty simple. It is piney hop aroma and not much else, I may detect a little sweetness. It is attractive.		Clean drinking beer, good bitterness all at the back finishes nearly completely. I would describe this as well balanced. As you drink it the aftertaste builds on you slightly, still a very drinkable beer. Body is medium, which is fine. I like this IPA."

The head recedes into a patchy layer on top leaving solid lacing.		Smells of large citrus and leafy hop aromas with light amounts of pale and caramel malts.		Tastes similar to how it smells. A combination of pale and caramel malt flavors up front are soon overtaken by bright citrus hop and earthy leafy hop flavors. Near the end of the sip the malt flavors take over and have a grainy quality before giving way to a solidly bitter and crisp ending.		Mouthfeel is good.

Smell - The hops are deep, rich, and complex here and quickly surpass the good malty base of this ale. There's a beautiful orange citrus here that isn't too sweet but more like the aroma of a fine orange liqueur. The stiff pine gives a contrasting compliment to the citrus and a bit of lemongrass to complete the puzzle.		Taste - The big malt base, almost like a DIPA, comes on much stronger at the taste and is amazingly able to hold its own against these huge, complex hops. The pine from the nose steps back a bit on the tongue but otherwise this ale tastes like it smells.		Mouthfeel - This is a solid medium-bodied with some large bitterness that is tempered by the light toffee sweetness of the malts. The carbonation is rightly light and overall this IPA has a terrific mouthfeel.		Drinkability - This is a big, complex IPA that seems like a double until you notice that the ABV is just slightly over 6%."

A - I was happy to see a real nice amber color to this beer as I poured it from the can into the glass I had just retrieved from the freezer. The only other canned beer I have tried recently that I can recommend is Dales Pale Ale. Many people cannot believe that a decent beer can come from a can. For the most part, I agree. This, as with Dales, is an exception. Knowing a decent canned beer is valued quintessentially to those of us who enjoy the back-country experience and like to pack out what we pack in. There is something special about being able to stick a couple of really good ales or IPA's in the snow on a telemarking trek and enjoy that beverage in the raw and untamed wild. I have had a few such occasions in the beautiful Arapahoe Nat. Forest of Summit County, CO. 		This ale poures into a chilled glass easily with a two to three finger, full, creamy head and leaves a sweet lacing on the glass, all the way to the last sip. The well carbonated ale continues to offer a flow of small bubbles consistently as it stands in the glass. As for the appearance, I have to say that I also am quite fond of the labeling. Anyone collecting cans should have a Caldera IPA in the line-up.		S - The smell of this beer is what you want folks who think beer stinks to sample. I could imagine Caldera IPA incense, the smell is so natural and becoming. I used to appreciate deeply the aroma of the pines and aspens as I guided horseback tours in the Colorado Divide, and this is what Caldera reminds me of. 		T - Caldera IPA tastes delicious. I love hoppy beers and this satisfies while I would say it won't scare off those who like a hoppy beer but are somewhat easily offended. It has a nice bitterness that says a solid hello from the tip of the tongue around both sides, but doesn't try to rip apart your mucous membranes with the vigor and skill of pissed off Norseman. The flavor is complex, sensuous and mystifying. The finish is crisp and clean and as I am experiencing at this very moment, one simply is not enough. My glass is in the freezer right now getting prepped for a second round. 		M - This IPA has a full bodied, smooth and delightful feel that is welcome on the palate, to be savored and swallowed slowly, eyes closed and head tilted slightly aft, slowly exhaling through the nose to extract the many intricacies that the craftsmen at Caldera have steeped into this marvelous 12 ounce can. 		D - At 6.1%, this IPA is very, very drinkable. Beware, if you are not on foot and close to home while enjoying Caldera IPA - it can sneak up on you. Filling? Not terribly for such a well built and hardy concoction. 		THE FINAL ANALYSIS: If you enjoy drinking beer, you must try Caldera IPA - especially if you like to drink out of bounds."
499,Caldera IPA,10784,1075,6.1,American IPA,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,1253213801,Slatetank,"I had this at Arena's Cafe in Rehoboth Beach, DE. Poured from the chilled can into a pint glass. 		A - A medium copper-like peach tea shade w/ a proud 3 fingers of cream, rocky headed w/ very fine bead and good lacing. 		S - A crisp, tropical hop odor w/ a pine and pineapple(orange according to octopus87)aroma w/ hints of light apricot and grapefruit in the nose w/ mild pepper. 		M - A crisp, juicy and mild sweet feel w/ a moderate carbonation level. Medium bitterness and slight spiciness w/ a resinous accent and residual bitterness in the finish		T - The taste is smooth w/ a spiced hop flavor that is fruity w/ hints of pineapple, mango and orange zest. There is a malt backbone that anchors the flavor w/ mild grain and sweetness in the taste. There are flavors that remind of peach w/ a slight spicy pepper mellow flavor. The beer creates nice hop burps as I near the end of the glass which can only mean I was refreshed by the taste.		D - I found this to be a very drinkable ale, a fine IPA w/ out any 'hop assault', but hoppy enough to satisfy your average hop fan. Still bitter flavored and refreshing -an almost ""must try"" IMO."

Citrus notes in the initial smell gives way to a hoppy and well carbonated first drink. I also pick up a little banana aroma.

A - Medium copper, clear, not much carbonation present, head was small and disappears rather quickly. 		S - Pale bready malt, citric hops. Not overpowering, but definitely there. 		T - Citric hops beat out the malt from the get go. If you are a hop head, you will like this for just a ""regular"" IPA. Bitter in a good way.		MF - Light to medium bodied. Crisp. Dry. Very nice.		D - $8.99 per six'r = $1.50 per 12oz. Cans a 0.5 adder too. So very drinkable given the price, medium body, and can.		Overall - This is a great IPA can or not.

Pours clear and deep golden/copper in color and offers a nice bubbly half inch of off white head. This settles to a surface cap in a minute or two but doesn't hold up to offer any lacing with the carbonation heading for the hills by half glass.		Nice blend of hops on the nose with some orange citrus and fresh cut pine, with a certain resiny quality in that regard. Hops are quite light and become a bit more elusive over time. Some clean fruity malt notes accompany. Good quality but not quantity.		Smooth in flavor and light in body as predicted from the nose. Finishes with a distinct and lingering orange flavor and just a hint of bitterness follows. Decent unobtrusive feel and drink.		This is an IPA 'Lite' for me. Light hops and malts, well balanced yes, but very light bodied for the style. Would have dubbed this an APA. Wonder what their Pale is like?"

Pours light amber or transparent copper with a one and a half finger white head. Plenty of bubbles rising to the top. Good retention and good lacing.		Aroma is of floral and earthy hops, candied oranges, and fruit juice. Tastes of grassy and piney hops with a touch of orange rind. Malt sweetness adds some balance, but not a lot. West Coast in terms of bitterness, but not a lot of aromatic or fruity hops. Finish has lots of bitter floralness. Medium bodied and sticky with full carbonation.		Very similar to the pale ale, but with more hopping and more malts. I thought initially this was better, but then realized I would rather have less of this flavor since I don't particularly enjoy it. Not enough malt to be ""balanced"" but not floral or fruity enough to be a tasty San Diego style either. So-so."

Well, I went with a glass. Old habits die hard....		Pours a golden copper color with half an inch of off-white head. Nice lacing clings to the glass.		The aroma, even after it warms, doesn't give me anything but grapefruit and tangerine hops. The scent, while very nice for an IPA, just seems muted. I guess I just want it more in my face and not so much like a sachet of hops thrown in a drawer. Make sense?		The flavor is more in my face...and I like it! I wish I could give this one a 4.25 cuz that is where I feel it belongs. Nice and bitter hops come out in a wide range of citrus flavors. It's pretty damn bitter, but that is why I like it. A bit earthy at the end. Also had a taste of powdered aspirin right at the finish. The finish keeps it from getting to that 4.5 for me.		Medium bodied. Average carbonation. Bitter, drying aftertaste screams for you to take another sip and I'll gladly oblige. Another canned beer worthy of any tailgating, camping, golfing, outdoor event of your choosing where bottles are frowned upon.

T: Wow! The hops pack a whallop both in the nose and in the finish of the taste, but the sweet malt coats the tongue and the throat and balances out nicely. The aftertaste of so many hops does take down the mouthfeel a bit, but the taste is definitely...tasty!!!		M: The hops sting a bit, even in the mouthfeel, but the malt is moderately thick, which helps wash everything down. The only drawback I can see is that the hops stick around so much in the aftertaste. It wants me to drink more, but it still is a little surprising.		D: This is a good IPA. Almost like a Firestone Pale Ale supercharged; the hops are front and center, and the malt does its job to try and balance it, but the overall impression is HOPS.

So it pours into the glass a lovely toasty bronze-rust color, with a crazy-fluffy head that looks like the top of a root-beer float. Lasts a long while too.		Nose is ultra-hoppy...very much veering into the fresh fabric-softener breeziness area. Not much else behind it, but gotta love it.		Flavor is delightful hoppiness all the way. Bright, breezy, a bit intense but not overwhelming. The malts carefully and successfully offer backup, or maybe more of a foundation than anything, as the prickly, colorful hops continue to be the magical ingredient with each sip. A little green, a little leafy, and very, very nice unless you're not into hops. A slight twist of graininess that reminds of rye carries through, especially into the finish. Also some candy-like sweetness, especially with a little warming.		Mouthfeel is neither here nor there. Not much to say about it, but it's fine. It's a medium-bodied beer with some prickly carbonation and a bit of stickiness.		A very solid IPA, and a very drinkable west-coast version of the style. It's not over-the-top while still exuding the character of its region, and the ABV makes it completely manageable if you're wanting several in a row."

A- Poured into an imperial pint glass, this beer pours a clear light-copper color with a sticky head of foam that reduces to a thin layer over the beer. Each sip leaves some web-like lacing along the inside of the glass. 		S- Piney, oily hop aromas with a malt backing that has a slight element of fruity sweetness but mostly smells of rich crakerish grain. There's a corse, almost metallic note to the smell, much like most of Sierra Nevada's beers. In fact, Caldera's IPA smells very much like a Sierra Nevada beer. Celebration Ale comes to mind. 		T- Lots of bitter grapefruit flavor. Grainy, bready malts provide minimal balance. Pithy flavors of melon rind lead the way to a dry finish that leaves a hoppy and slightly metallic bitterness lingering on the palate. 		M- The mouthfeel is very full-bodied with some nice fizzy carbonation that complements the thick and somewhat oily texture.		D- The 6.1% ABV makes it easy to have a few of these in a row, but I would have liked a little more fruity sweetness in the flavor to balance out the big bitterness.		A very tasty IPA. Bring on the canned beers!"

My first craft beer from a can.		A-Clear amber-orange with 1 1/2 finger, off-white head with average retention and moderate lacing. Very pleasing appearance.		S-Piney hops with some citrus aroma present. Very inviting.		T-Somewhat disappointing since the flavor does not match well with expected smell and is dominated by earthy bitterness that is ultimately unbalanced. I couldn't discern any malt backbone. Very bitter, persistent after taste. Not very pleasant. Unsure about freshness, but this has not been a concern from the seller/distributors. I like hoppy IPAs, but prefer balance too. Balance was absent.		M-Begins well but ends up being harsh because of the after taste. Low to medium carbonation gives is it a smoothness that is unfortunately emasculated by the bitterness. 		D-An average West Coast IPA. Okay, but I won't buy again. The bitter aftertaste nearly gave me heartburn.		If offered one to drink I would drink it but only after concluding nothing better is available. A bit pricey compared to better Oregon brewed IPAs. I bought this today because I wanted to try some different IPAs on hot day in the Willamette Valley. Overall, I was nonplussed."

S: Complex and sumptuous aromas of pine, citrus, sweet caramel and pale malt, tropical fruit, and leaf all come through to present a most appetizing brew.		T: the flavor does not deliver fully on the promising smell and it is dominated by earthy, leafy bitterness that leaves all complexity behind. The malt flavors peek through to a minor extent with some balancing sweetness. This is a great beer for hopsheads who like pure raw bitterness hitting them in the mouth.		M: Pretty slick and coating with low-medium carbonation and a spicy-bitter aftertaste.		D: A not bad, not great IPA that won't win any awards for value. It will win for rawness and unrestrained bitterness, which, even though I like hoppy IPAs, is not my favorite combination."

Even it's color, in a different sense, could be described as caramel. It was a pretty good beer, but I prefer my IPAs to be a little more hop dominant, and a little less malty. I enjoyed it, but I didn't think it was anything to write home about.		Color was a dark rich amber color, with a good amount of head. Aroma was malt first, with lots of caramel notes and some hoppiness. Flavor was exceedingly balanced, more like an amber ale than an IPA, with the hops just barely peeking out from behind more caramel flavor. Mouthfeel was light, crisp, and pleasant. Quite a satisfying beer, but it didn't really scratch my itch for hops.		A huge thank you to JaBier for gifting me a can of this beer; otherwise I probably never would have tried it."

Started out with a big off-white head that fades immediately to a little layer of wispy foam over the top of my glass.		Very pleasant right off. It started out very bitter with citrus hop oils but there's a solid caramel malt flavor that fights through. Each sip has a great bitter/sweet interplay of hops and malt.

The aroma is strong, immediately apparent from several feet away - malty and fairly conventional IPA aroma, perhaps a bit of Amarillo hops or something similar. The flavor is pleasant and grainy, with a sharp hop bitterness and a nutty, toasty edge. Again, this seems seems strongly suggestive of Amarillo, with a sharp orangy character, particularly of the bitterness, which seems like that dry, bitter character from Orange zest.

I had been wanting to try this for a while now. Served cold and poured into a pint glass, this one was consumed on 06/26/2009.		The pour was very nice. Deep amber in color with a nice clarity to it. A big head of white coming up and over the top and settling down with a good amount of side glass lacing. Big aroma of fresh hops on this one. Just a huge nose of grapefruit, pineapple and hints of orange peel. Deep and resionous, almost sticky just in the aroma. As the first sip hits, not as sharp and pungent as the aroma, but seriously this was a good IPA. Nice and tight with the fresh hops letting your lips stick to your teeth. Lots of pineapple and grapefruit leading the way but fading into a nice mid palate of buttery malts. Nice medium feel and an easy, very smooth sessionability.		Overall this was excellent. A very easy to drink, very nice and very hoppy west coast IPA. I would go for this one again any day!"

The head lives a good amount of sticky lacing all over the glass. Aromas of floral and herbal hops with a sweet but bready maltiness as a distance backbone. Earthy notes in both the aroma and taste.

A: Pours a clear amber body with active carbonation up the glass. Has an inch off-white head with good retention, and it leaves some spots of lacing down the glass. 		S: Citrus and pine hops, with a slight resiny and earthy/dirt/grass undercurrent to it that is a bit of a turnoff. 		T: As the nose suggests, the taste is dominated by citrus hops, with pine coming second. Caramel malt fleshes out the mid-taste, but toward the end, an earthy and grassy blend takes over and pulls throught into the aftertaste. There is a lingering resiny bitterness as a result. 		M: Sticky, with bitter resin coating the mouth. Sometimes I like this, but here it's too grassy and earthy to enjoy. 		D: I really wanted to try this, and I'm glad I did -- because I'm satisfied that I don't need to have it again. It's apparently pretty pricey, and there's nothing in here that justifies that to me."

T - Funny how your brain needs to adjust when drinking out of a can; first sip of this was during a round of golf, right out of the can and my first thought was, ""wow, this is GOOD beer"" because you're expecting something thin and watered down. A ""proper"" tasting confirms my first sip; poured into a glass, this is a damn good, drinkable IPA. Nice hint of sweetness up front which is quickly run over by a nice rindy, bittery-y flavor which hangs around on the tongue for quite a while between sips.

Huge (two to three finger) rocky, foamy, off-white head that's taking it's time diminishing.		Nose is a pleasant balance of citrus and pine, both sweet and earthy at once. The hops are clear, but frankly are less enticing that it seems they ought to be. Nothing about how this beer smells turns me away, but there's not much to really draw me in.		Caldera IPA is surprisingly mild on first sip, with the pine and citrus hop balance eventually coming through. Relatively subtle but clear bitterness complements the beer without overtaking it. Pleasant lingering mild bitterness in the finish, with an overall sense of earthiness.		Light to medium bodied, leaning toward light. Slight drying effect makes me want another sip. A solid, drinkable beer, and the light body actually boosts the drinkability rating. Still, for $14.99 a six-pack I'll gladly stick with something else. This is a good IPA, but not good enough to command such a price."

Sweet malts and oily hops rise pleasantly to the nose. Some subtle pine is mixed in. Tastes of bright fresh citrusy hops and the malt backbone does it's job evening things out well. Not as big on the hops as many other IPA's, but being that it comes in the can this one begs to be taken to the lake or to the beach as it has just enough taste to keep things interesting, and the fact that it's in a can is fookin' cool."

A: The IPA is a full amber color, a mixture of brown and yellow that results in an dull orange hue. A luxurious head of nearly two fingers has laced in spades.		S: The aroma is strong, even fresh out of the can. Thick grapefruit and pine notes battle to attention. An odd malt aroma, very vegetal and regurgitated. It tempers the beauty of the hops.		T: This is an IPA that fires on all cylinders. The hops are fresh, loaded with citrus and pine flavor. The bitterness is fairly low but it is there, lingering below the surface. The caramel grains stand out, pairing nicely with the hops.		M: The IPA really hits the spot with a large hop profile that bites as it soothes. A good beer that screams West coast IPA.		D: A very quaffable ale that doesn't skimp on the hops. Too bad the nose was a little offputting."

A nice billowy, two-finger head forms,(and sticks around) possibly the result of a forced hard-pour from the can.		A big dose of piney, earthy hops hits hard up front in the nose. The resiny qualities of the aroma subside after a bit, and a sweet malt backbone comes through towards the end. 		Up front, this beer has a very bitter, resiny hop thwack, as much as several ""DIPA's"" I've had. There's also a fruitiness from the hops that complements the sweet malt backbone very well, as well as helping this be a very balanced beer. Moderate carbonation makes this medium-light on the palate and refreshing.		Solid West Coast IPA, and probably the coolest looking can on the market."

A: In my Duvel glass, this IPA sits a rather dark amber with an off-white head with good retention and gorgeous lacework.

Hop flavor is moderate with a little bit of citrus. Thin malt backbone with a hint of caramel sweetness.

Pours a clear medium amber with a pillowy, almost nitro-looking head that stays put.	The first aroma is hops, as you would expect in a West Coast IPA. Lots of grapefruit and pine, a little bit of grass. Brown sugar and lightly toasted bread malts are present.	Flavors mimic the aroma pretty closely. Lots of grapefruit, pine and grass. The malts come through more than in the aroma. 	Medium bodied. Somewhat low carbonation, again resembling a nitro beer. A little sticky/oily.	Pretty drinkable. Nice flavors and body.

A rather tame aroma consisting of grass, floral-pine, sourdough, with a touch of funk. Images of that candy I got every Halloween, bottlecaps, creep into my head. 		Piney, earthy hops attack the palate; more flower than citrus in this NW IPA. Just enough caramel and bready malt to provide a little balance with touches of butterscotch.

Clearly he read my mind about the need for smaller glasses in the house. Thanks Marc!		The 12 oz. goes into the tulip with about an ounce or so to spare.

What did I get myself into? 		Ah, I see. I got myself into a kick-ass IPA I've never heard of before. The taste is aggressively hopped, pleasantly oily, bitter, sharp, clean, & all the things a good IPA claims to be. Wow. First-class IPA. Really, really good. 		I could drink these all night. 		Thanks Mr. Hophead, I am going to put this on my wants list hoping people will drop a can or two in as extras.

Slightly sweet, somewhat light bodied, but definitely hoppy. A nice bitterness clings to the palate and lingers for quite some time in a long, bitter, dry finish. Up front the bitterness takes on a decidedly herbal note with touches of hemp, biting pine flavors and a bit of herbal / green-grassy notes. This is definitely nice and quaffable, it is not overly sweet nor thick for an IPA, though the hop character definitely tends to cling to the palate. The first sips, as well as sips where I have gone and done something else for a while, have a much more prominent citrus hop character (with orange zest, grapefruit notes, kumquat and perhaps a touch of lychee); otherwise the herbal and bitter hop flavors dominate.		The flavor is much more harsh and aggressive than the aroma suggested, but it will certainly still be enjoyable for the hop heads out there. A solid IPA, that could actually use a touch more malt, or to dial back the herbal and bitter hop character.		Purchased: Liquid Solutions"

Good head retention and lacing.		Smell: Lots and lots of grapefruit from the hops. Extremely well done. Not overbearing but undeniably grapefruit rind goodness. 		Taste: Closer to a pale ale with a lot of grapefruit character. Not sure if its chinook hops or cascade that are being used here. 		Mouthfeel: A bit thin for my liking.

A: Pours a completely clear golden orange color with a firm off-white/light-orange cap of puffy foam. Lots of bubbly and sticky lace left behind. Lazily carbonated.		S: Big piney hop nose right off the bat. I also pulled out aromas of orange, caramel, grapefruit, tangerine, and a pinch of pineapple. Also noticed a medicinal/aspirin type aroma that was strangely apealing.		T: Big bitter pine with a fine coating of toasted malt and caramel. This sports a plethora of citrus and tropical fruit flavors with elements of cut grass and metal.		M: Spicy astringency that's balanced by the sweet and creamy caramel malt. Finish turns bitter and dry with an underlying peppery hop quality that keeps things pretty interesting.		D: This was a very nice surprise. This IPA drinks exceptionally well. Excellent balance between bitter & dry hops and sweet maltiness."
596,Caldera IPA,10784,1075,6.1,American IPA,4,4,4,4,4.5,1222305980,CrellMoset,"Can as an extra from flexabull in a trade - thanks! Poured into a traditional American pint glass.		Appearance: Pours a healthy-looking clear orange amber-bodied brew. A mild pour coaxed a good one-plus finger white foamy head with above average staying power that leaves some sticky, creamy lacing as it fades away, sort of randomly thrown across the sides of the glass. Very good start.		Aroma: Great west coast aroma. That one-two citrus-pine combo is so traditional for a reason - it smells great. This one's not overstated, and compliments the roasted, sticky, doughy malt backbone well. 		Taste: Expertly balanced. It's not too bitter or too malty, and the maltiness isn't too sweet or too dry. Hop profile is a little milder than I'd like, but more so than a lot of IPAs - I'm just very demanding of my hops, I suppose. Leafy floral notes, pine, and lots of grapefruit makes for a good hop profile.		Mouthfeel: Medium-to-full bodied, fairly fluffy, but very even and creamy, precisely what you'd expect from the look of the head. Carbonation is precise and pronounced, a little prickly, and the hop oils increase the slickness factor ever so sightly.		Drinkability: A great, drinkable, sessionable IPA in a can that hits all the right notes without knocking any of them out of the park. But that's not what you're looking for with this one. Portable, tasty, aromatic, pleasant looking ... this one definitely comes recommended, and many thanks to flexabull for sending this one my way."

Nose smells of west coast hoppage and some malts. Taste follows, good grapefruit hop flavor with some spiciness in there as well. A good malt backbone, but not overwhelmingly sweet. Mouthfeel is pretty much just what it should be, but could be just a touch thinner. Drinkability is very good here, as this one is defenitley summer slammable. Overall a good beer, solid session IPA, and a good option for those seeking craft portability. Its not Oskar Blues, Its not Surly, but its still craft beer in a can baby."

Crisp citrus smell with a hop presence as well. I taste hops right up front, with a dry bitter citrus finish. Much better as it warms. The head pretty much disappeared, but left some nice lacing. I can absolutely get a subtle tangerine smell from the beer, but a strong smell from the can. This is a very good canned beer. I wish I could buy it around here."

603,Caldera IPA,10784,1075,6.1,American IPA,4,4,5,4.5,4.5,1216685474,RedDiamond,"Caldera IPA is my new best friend. And I'm wondering if the can has something to do with it. 		For decades canned beer deserved the stigma attached to it. The aluminum adversely impacted the taste, lending a tawdry metallic quality that was the hallmark of industrial beer production. This problem has been solved in recent years by coating the inside of the can with a food-grade polymer that effectively keeps the beer off the aluminum. No more unsavory beer can taste. 		Today it's not merely a matter of acknowledging that canned beer ""works."" It's now prudent to ask whether it's an altogether better idea than beer in a bottle. And Caldera's IPA is a fine candidate for the notion that canned beer is an idea whose time has come. 			Caldera IPA's aroma is floral and leafy. The leaf is so fresh it's almost sticky. It imparts a tall airy head of majestic suds amid lively carbonation in a sunny topaz color. The body is vivid and clear though marred by a few wayward flocs.			The taste reminds me of Fire Station 5 with perfectly posited bittering that takes your hand and walks you through a lush garden of herbal hop flavor. Piney, peachy elements interweave from an ideal balance of hop flavor and malty sustenance. And the mouthfeel is flawless - plush, meandering, and exquisitely quaffable. Even the head delights in its own fluffiness.			An ideal go-to beer for any occasion."

Poured a 12oz can into a snifter		Appearance - Produced a creamy 1 finger head that lasted for quite a while before dissipating to a thick crown across the surface of the brew. Light lacing is left behind as the head shrinks. It is a hazy transparent golden orange color.		Smell - Damn, this smells pretty awesome. The scent of candied orange explodes out of the glass. Almost like Sunkist orange soda spiked with hops - but without the artificial orange scent. Very bright. Citrus rind and sugar and the primary scents that I detect. 		Taste - The taste is nice, but nowhere near as nice as the scent. Citrusy hops and slight cracker-like malts make an appearance in the initial flavor, with a thin sugary sweetness in the middle and then runs flat - all before a surge of bitter hops rounds out the backend and aftertaste. It isn't balanced by any means - but it is tasty. If only it tasted as good as it smelled.		Mouthfeel - The mouthfeel is pretty nice. There is are tiny, very fine textured carbonation bubbles that prick the tip of your tongue as you sip, and then runs creamy by the time it hits the back of the throat. I would have enjoyed a little more carbonation in the backend to liven things up, but I always enjoy a beer that can be both crisp and creamy at the same time.		Drinkability - This is a very solid brew. It is a nice, easy drinking beer, but I wish that it had a more balanced flavor - or at least a flavor that tasts as good as it smells. The hops seen to be a little out of whack - I would have enjoyed a more prevalent malt profile. But it smells awesome, and I do get my hop fix. If this was available in Texas, I could easily see this becoming a part of my regular beer rotation."

Poured a golden orange color with a creamy, two-inches of off-white head. Strings of lace were seen clinging to the sides of my glass.		The nose was citrusy in a grapefruity sort of way, with some peppery notes. Definitely seemed like a WCIPA. 		A bit more herbal in the taste than in the nose, and there's a pineyness that didn't seem to come through in the aroma, all in addition to the citrus noted in the nose. Bone dry finish. While diverse in terms of hoppiness, the malts seem a little too anemic for the beer's own good, and the hops aren't beefy enough to be a true scorcher of an IPA. 		Fairly light bodied, though with a mouthfeel that is mildly slick with hop resin.		A mediocre IPA. Beefing up the malts to provide a bit more counterpoint would improve it. Should I find myself in Ashland, I'll give this a try on tap. For now, I'm glad I tried it, but this won't make me switch from Laughing Dog's IPA (my local, go-to IPA)anytime soon."

Pours crystal clear with a fluffy off-white head that leads loads of lacing on the glass. Nice orange light-amber color bordering on light coppery tone.		Aroma is just loaded with citrusy, tangerine hops. Not much subtlety there.		Flavor is a lot more complex. There's tangerine, pine, and floral hops. A touch of caramel and a touch of maltiness, and even a touch of grassiness. Nicely ""balanced"" (for what it is) but practically speaking, still hop-heavy.		Mouthfeel is suitably bitter, but not near the max of the style, and has a nice dry finish--refreshing compared to many heavy, sugary IPAs in its class. 		Drinkability is good, but the bitter front and dry finish might actually go better with a bit less flavor and aroma. This is a nice complement to their Pale Ale, one of my favorite beers, and I think I like this one's hop bill even better. 		Highly recommended."

Like their Pale Ale I just reviewed, this is the first time I've ever not had this beer in a can, but I'm not nearly as impressed. Served at fridge temp.		Smell is pure, resiny cannabis - ah, Oregon! To be more specific, it's more of the cat piss style, which you probably won't care for unless you have the mental association. I was just working on my goggle tan at Mt. Ashland this past Wednesday, and by the number of heads goofing off with me on a work day, it's obvious this town operates on a slightly slower speed. With a smell like this, I think Caldera's trying to remind us there's always time to chill...		Taste is pungent, resiny hops, firm malt backbone with a big bitter finish. The slightest touch of sweet caramel malt loses the battle to the big buds, which pack enough lupin to knock out Bobby Brown on a 3 day coke binge. 		Mouthfeel is creamy but dry and crisp, with a heavier body. 		Drinkability is average. I like a lot more hop flavor then bitterness, and this IPA is pretty much the opposite, and a bit thick for my taste as well. I'll still give it bonus points for the can, not to mention that dank aroma that I never noticed from the can."

Pours a nice amber color, between a caramel and apple juice hue. A soft inch of foam quickly forms and trickles slowly to a thin layer, leaving behind some lacing on the side of the glass.		Very decent hop aroma. There seems to be a good balance of citrus fruits and pine aromas. The traditional grapefruit is there along with some bitter orange and maybe some tangerine and nectarine. The toasted malt aromas and caramel tries to peek from behind the hops but so far it's mostly hops on top. A touch of bread dough and slightly spicy hops.		Taste is of bitter citrus, citrus zest, and pine with a slightly metallic flavor in the finish. Toasted malts and toasted bread with just a hint of caramel make up the malt backbone.

As it warms more of a complex earthiness with mild tree bark notes ring out but underneath all those hops a subtle layer of malt sugars arise bringing out sweet candy like notes. Flavor is upfront with brash bitterness yet enough malt sweetness comes out to party, this is west coast style IPA all the way. Hop bitterness reigns supreme with grapefruit citrus peel bitterness and more of that earthy dirt layer coming through. Mouthfeel the hop bitterness consumes your palate it really sticks around it makes you feel like you have to scrape the hops off your tongue, I love it. Once again I love the can format, this is great to get this much hop flavor out of a near 6%abv brew coming right out of a can. Next time I hit up an outdoor event where drinking takes place I will remember this beer and wish I had at least a case on hand. Very green yet biscuit malts and mild caramel twang make so drinkable the palate gets used to those brash bittering hops and adjusts to all the other flavors my palate has a found it's equilibrium and no shit this is an outstanding IPA in a can.

I opted for the DFH pint glass here and the ale pours out a crystal clear orange with a copper grapefruit hue. A white two-finger head tops off a good looking beer. Nice lacing.		Tantilizing bouquet: floral and perfumey hops accented by a strong citrus presence. The overall effect of hops and malt is sweet and tangy.		Flavors are nicely balanced with just a slight bent towards the hoppy side. Orange and grapefruit mingle with spicy and floral and it's all about centennial hops. Whatever it's hop makeup, it's tasty.		It's weighty on the palate with a somewhat grainy texture and ample carbonation.		I could drink this regulary, it's damn good and I'm tempted to compare it to Two Hearted Ale. Seriously."

With Surly, Caldera, and others now proving that canned beer can be as good or better than bottles, I tihnk in another 5 years the market will explode. 		Brick/rusty orange flows into my pint glass from the brightly designed can. Smaller head, though the lacing sticks to the side of my glass with tenacity. 		Aroma is a bit weak compared to other PacNW IPA's. However, after the brew warmed up a bit, there was a noticable improvement in the strength. Noticed hops of course. More sweet florals that other IPAs. Grapefruit, lemon, cannabis. 		Flavor was superb. For the first second, I notice a sweet smoothness. Then the hops set in and I am awash in bitter pine and citrus. Again, cannabis notes as well. The finish has caramel and bitter earthen/soil characteristics. 		I really like this one, and get no metallic or other ""can""-like flavors. (not that I expected to). I've got a 6-pack, and I would like to drink at leas tone straight from the can, it seems like the thing to do."

Smell: Nice citrus hop aroma thats pretty minimal of a NW IPA, a nice chance. 		Taste: Malt flavor is rapidly replaced with a pretty bitter lasting hop finish. T		Mouthfeel: darn easy drink....		Drinkability: Tasty beer, Id drink this again."

Smell: Aroma of caramel malts with an herbal, citrus hop presence.		Taste: Mild caramel malt flavor and sweetness. Zesty citrus hops and the taste of fresh herbs. A pinch more of those caramel malts reemerge for the overall bitter finish.		Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium carbonation. Slight stickiness to the mouthfeel.		Drinkability: Whaddya know, it's a fairly good IPA."

628,Caldera IPA,10784,1075,6.1,American IPA,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,1194792567,BuckeyeNation,"Polished brew kettle coppery orange with butter rum edges. The good looking crown is some combination of ivory, ecru and pale orange. It has the look and leaves the lace of a beer that contains a generous amount of hop resins. At least I hope so.		The nose is nicely hoppy, but it isn't explosively hoppy. I blame the fact that the brewers decided to use too much Munich and crystal at the expense of pale malt. The hops (Crystal, Galena, and Centennial) provide grapefruit and orange esters, along with a strong whiff of ganja. Close to excellent, but no cigar. Edit: by the last ounce... cigar.		I feel the same way about the flavor... at least after two mouthfuls. Who knows what time, warming and the rest of the can might accomplish? These guys definitely love to hop their beer, but then that's almost a requirement in Oregon, isn't it? I wish the website listed the IBUs. I'm thinking 70ish.		The sturdy malt backbone, again, contains a healthy amount of toasted earthiness from the Munich and steely caramel from the crystal. It also provides an underlying sweetness that keeps things from being more arid on the back end than they already are. Caramel-soaked orange and grapefruit pith and peel zings across the tongue with each mouthful, leaving shallow alpha acid furrows rather than deep trenches.		The mouthfeel is IPA medium; perhaps a bit more full due to a wonderful creaminess as it gains a few degrees. The amount and feel of the carbonation strikes me as just about right. Are all 12 ounces gone already?		Prior to Surly blowing the entire concept sky-high, Caldera Pale Ale was my favorite canned beer. IPA is at least as good. It's a terrific, drinkable beer that I have no trouble recommending to anyone, hophead or not. If you have a few slots to fill in your Liquid Solutions order, you could do much worse than to fill them with either Caldera Pale Ale or Caldera IPA."

Slightly hazy, copper color, with some gold streaks. Nice fluffy white head. Great retention, and lace as one might expect from a northwest IPA. 		Nice blast of hops up the nose, grapefruit, tangerine, floral and pine. Smells quite fresh. Good amount of malty notes in the nose as well.		Fair amount of sweetness up front, along with a decent blast of citrusy, floral and slightly piney hops. Seems to fade into a bit of grassy flavor as well. Very nice.		Good body, very easy to drink. This seems pretty solid to me, and an easy drinker."

Appearance- Beer pours a hazy dark orange with a nice frothy head with large bubbles filling about a 3 finger head. A chill haze is present, light lacing.		Smell- Big floral hop smacks me right in the face, this smells like a nice fresh IPA. Smells like there is a decent amount of malt on this one to balance as well.		Taste- Rich fluffy hops and a very nice light malt bringing in the rear. This is a nice balanced IPA, there is a bit of metallic can character as well. 		Mouthfeel- The metallic flavor comes in and lingers on the mouthfeel. The carbonation seems to wear down quite a bit as well. Still a medium bodied, crisp beer.		Drinkability- The drinkability on this IPA is quite good. This is the sort of beer one could stand to have by the 'suitcase' although it has more of the maturity for the established craft beer drinker. Great swilling beer."

Off white, and just won't go away. A beer that when you take a sip the head sticks on your mouth for a foam mustache. Thick completely engulfing lace completely down the glass.		Damn I love the canned beers. Fresh smack of in your face hops. Lovely floral tones with a piney aspect with a hint of stone fruits. A thick caramel toffee really brings things together and adds a sense of sweetness to the aroma.		Very floral and perfumey on the finish. Slightly lacking on the mid palate and on the finish a gritty almost metallic hop bitterness. Caramel malt rests behind the floral tones and could be a little more pronounced. A bit of peach and blood orange also say hello. 		Mouth is lacking the creamy thickness that more malting could have brought and it dissapoints. This beer just barely misses from being great, otherwise a very solid IPA."

It pours a amber color with a nice sea foam head. The smell is strong of hops. The taste hits you with a dry hop appeal with a huge hop profile. It leaves a stinging pleasant aftertaste as it journeys down the throat. I really like the uniqueness of the this American IPA profile.

Appears a hazy, light orange with a small white head that fades into a mild collar and film. Spotty lacing is left around the glass.	Smell is nice of citrusy hops, along with some notes of pine sap and herbs.	Taste is of the mentioned aromas with caramel and citrus notes battling it out with a mild spiciness going on in the flavor.	Mouthfeel is medium bodied, yeasty, sweet up front, and bitter on the end."

That lemon-yellow package, though new on the maket, is already easy to spot... Another classic phrase regarding keeping the beer at a proper temperature: ""Live Product. Keep Cool, Just Like You"".		A: Pours a light amber color and immaculately clear with almost 4-fingers of billowing sandy tan-colored head. Fades to about 1/2-finger. What remains is both rocky and creamy, full of both bubbles and crust. Hardly any carbonation and a faint suspended haziness. 		S: Aroma is all citrus, full of pithy grapefruit and traces of lemon and sweeter orange. What caramel malt there is is folded into a neat envelope of juicy hops.		T: Pithy bitterness sprays from this IPA from the first taste. There is very little malt getting through here; this is an fairly unbalanced hop explosion. Lots of grapefruit bitterness and pine resin - very little caramel malt or other sweetness getting through. 		M: Medium mouthfeel, but with a long-lasting hoppy cling. This has orange, grapefruit and pine nesting on the center and back of the tongue. Carbonation is low and somehow the mouthfeel is fleeting and just a little thin.		D: A good IPA, certainly worthy of grabbing one (or a 6-pack) if in Oregon. I think hopheads will really enjoy the full citrus-hop flavor from this, although I found it just a little one-dimensional/overbearing. A flavorful IPA I'd certainly have again, however..."

In a CAN!		If I hadn't had two, I wouldn't be able to report on color. I simply had to experience this straight from the can. Why? To me, canned beer is typically reserved for frat boys, red necks, and those who live under a bridge, so the inherent conundrum of a can to my lips with a tasty IPA flowing across my palate was too hard to resist. As confusing as it was, I must say, it was worth it!		Caldera IPA - can #2		Nice burned orange color with a good two-finger head thanks to a quick pour.

Taste is completely bittering with a smooth body. Black pepper in the taste, as well as that earthiness to it. Light carbonation brings out the slight malty flavors. Mostly though its pretty hoppy."

Smells like a hop bomb with strong citrus, rind and a tiny bit of floral. Blows away your taste buds with hops and a bite of citrus. The balance isnt as great as it could be but this sure is tasty, especially if you are a hop head. Finishes wonderfully dry and bitter but doesnt linger too long on the tongue.

Pours a slightly hazy golden color topped by a beautiful creamy white head. Nice, creamy lacing all the way down the glass. Nose of fresh, spicy hops and a touch of light sweet malt. Palate is redolent of spicy hops, light sweet malt, and notes of pine, black pepper, grass, and just a hint of bready sweetness. Body is absolutely perfect - rich, creamy, and without the syrupy character that many stronger IPAs tend to carry. Man, I chose the right one here.

The taste was great. Very hoppy and bitter with a kind of sweet citrus tone to it as well.

The beer was a slightly cloudy bronze orange with a nice white head. Good lacing.		Nice citrus nose. Not, sure, but Im guessing cascade hops. Whiffs of fresh bread as well.		This is a nice solid IPA. A liberal use of hops adds a distinctive citrus bite. Some more floral tones emerge  way through the beer. Seems slightly under malted, but still tasty. 		The carbonation is perfect for this beer and it also has a slightly oily quality. Drinkabity suffers a touch by the slight lack of balance. Still, an enjoyable IPA."

Not too many noticeable bubbles. 		Big time grapefruit and piney hops hit the nose immediately, caramel and some yeasty characteristics.		The aroma matches the taste quite accurately. Sweet caramel with bready yeast mixes with piney and grapefruit hops. Slight metalic bitterness is noted as well but is quite tasty nonetheless.		Light body, light but noticeable carbonation. Very easy to drink although there is a lasting dry bitterness feeling but it leaves the mouth moist. 		This is a pretty straight forward IPA with the bitter hops being the main focus but there is enough sweetness to smooth it out. This is definitely a worthy IPA to check out for Hopheads."

Maybe its my nose, but I don't detect too much - citrusy hops with a pine undergirding. But the taste is exceptional. Wonderfully bright hops and a satisfying malt backbone. But like most west coast ipas, this is not balanced...thankfully. A hops explosion of grapefruit, spice, and pine. Awesome. This is the best IPA i've had in a can...and one of the better ones around PERIOD. Check this one out."

It poured a hazy amber orange and produced a about one finger high, white bubbly head. It dissipates fast and leaves good lacing.

Light sunset orange color with perfect clarity and a grayish-white head that deposits speckles of lace. 		Honeyed biscuits and spicy hops in nose. Clean, understated and balanced. 		Calderas website says this was brewed with Centennial, Simcoe and Amarillo -- which has me confused, because my taste buds are calling these hops earthy and spicy, with none of the usual snap of American-grown hops. Perhaps its the abundance of malt throwing things off  theres a lot of toasty biscuits, bread and uncooked pale barley before the clean, dry finish.		The medium body exhibits a very light touch of carbonation and soft silky fizziness. Lightly bitter.		I found Calderas IPA very similar to their pale, with maybe a half step up in each category. While both beers are enjoyable enough, they lack the hoppy bite I crave in American-brewed versions of this style."

Taste - Hops at first, more pine in the flavor than in the smell. Malty behind it. Biscuit malts and a touch of caramel. Not sweet at all, but malty nonetheless. Tastes like an ESB, too.		Mouthfeel - Just a tad heavier than medium bodied. Feels heavier because of low carbonation. Has the feel of an ESB, too!		Overall - Not as hoppy as I would like from an IPA.

A - A clear golden orange, slightly burnt red color body with a medium frothy light white head.		S - Very nice and big citrus hop smell that is smooth and sweet. Very pleasant.		T & M & D - Great fruit sweetness up front that is refreshing and almost minty cool. Then some bigger malty sweetness on mid palate and the slight fruit acidity cleans the end and brings in some slight airy floral notes. The mouth is light and very drinkable, I go back to refreshing. 		O - Awesome IPA and I love the can. They really pull of the style well. One of my favorites that I come back to often.		-Cheers"

The beer poured out as a clear yellowish gold color, it has a pretty good looking soapy head on it. The lacing is a little sticky but not too much. The smell of the beer has a really nice malty and hoppy aroma. The hops smell bright and fruity. The taste of the beer was pretty good. The hops were definitely in there ready to hit ya in the mouth. The malt cleaned up the mess in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel was light and refreshing. Overall it was a pretty good IPA."
664,Caldera IPA,10784,1075,6.1,American IPA,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,1309206819,SaCkErZ9,"I purchased a six pack of this at Peabodys in Boone. I had not idea that the six pack was going to $12. Seems pricey to me, cans or bottles. Anyhoo. I cracked open the first one and was immediately greeted by a ton of fresh hop aroma in the face. Awesome! Piney and citrusy with some oiliness. 		Pours from the can into a pint glass an amber color with a nice, one inch size and very foamy head with great retention and lacing. 		Taste is pretty darn spot on. Slightly sweet up front with plenty of hop flavor and hop bitterness at the end. There seems to be a bit of alkalinity that adds some artificial and chalky bitterness that keep this one from being a classis. As it is, this is a real winner. 		Some may disagree, but this is one hell of a ""session"" IPA. ABV is kept in check and this one goes down so smooth. Maybe it was worth the $12. Actually, I say it was."

Dense with tightly packed bubbles. Settles very slowly, leaving lacing on the glass and a thin, creamy topping.		Tons of pine hops, with aromas of resin and pitch. Floral hops as well. Caramel malts and a touch of apricot sweetness.		Quick hitting flavors at first, with biscuit malts followed by bitter pine hops. Very slight raisin flavors appear mid-palate. A grapefruit citric bite develops as well. There's a long lasting, drying bitterness from the hops, enhanced by high carbonation. Crisp and clean."

S- Huge notes of citrus: grapefruit and orange.		T- A good tasting IPA. Nice even bitter hoppy flavor throughout. Can't taste any alcohol which makes for an easy drinking beer.		This is a good West Coast IPA but it is lacking a little when compared with other beers of the same style and region."

Nice big off-white head leaves sticky remnants all over the glass. The nose is mild caramel malts with a restrained, slightly grapefruit hop presence. The taste is pretty mild. Some lightly tropical, but mostly generic bitterness is largely overshadowed by the heavy caramel malt presence (though not a big sweetness - this beer is pretty dry). Seems somewhat out of balance. Mouthfeel is strong in carbonation and a medium body with some malty stickiness. Overall, this is a very drinkable, very (caramel) malt forward IPA with a mild tropical/generic bitterness. Not nearly my favorite, but not bad. I would call it pretty distinctly average."

Poured amber with a nice head and great lacing. Smells very fruity with candied orange peel and grapefruit pith. The taste is very full, with bitter hops, breadiness. Sharp pine and earth in the hop profile. A little chewy in the mouth, but ovarall this is dry, bitter, and delicious."

Medium bodied with an oily feel and aggressive carbonation. Solid caramel malty aroma with a hint of citrusy grapfruit hop flavor near the finish. 	Orange citrus flavores up front that transitions to bitter pine hop flavor that quickly follows thru the middle and to the finish. Noce caramel malt undertone throughout. Decent hop character and balance but lacked the hop intensity of a really goof IPA."

Grapefruit, heavy pinetrees, kiwi, kumquat, lemon, grainy tree sap, and tea leaves. There is a sugary sweetness in there, but the woody dry hopping curbs it. Subtly malted.		M ~ Good showcase of Good American hops, with a curious sweetness and a very dry finish. Screams for you to drink more. I believe I downed this one in 3 minutes it was that incredible.

Pours a clear golden color with an average white head and a slight amount of white lacing on the way down. The nose brings quite a bit of citrus hop character, mostly tending toward grapefruit. Quite nice. The flavor has just a touch of malt in the background and is instead focused on a fairly-heavy hop presence. Orange and grapefruit come through and perhaps a bit of a floral character. Medium body with good bitterness. Nice and dry. Solid brew."

There was no date on the can so I'm not sure how fresh it was, and thinking my can was a touch old based on my perception vs some of the other reviews.		Aroma - slightly cloudy, murky copper, decent foam that faded quickly but left some lacing around the top of the glass		Smell - very little hop aroma, maybe just a hint of citrus and a little more pine, but really had to work to smell it		Taste - malty sweetness then bitterness, but nothing outstanding in the way of distinct flavors		Mouthfeel - decent carbonation, lower alcohol for an IPA, easy to drink		Overall - I had this at a tasting not too long ago and remembered it being much better, so I'm thinking the can I bought may have been old. That said this is a decent IPA, nice that it's in a can, but also nothing stands out about it, either."
677,Caldera IPA,10784,1075,6.1,American IPA,4,5,4,4.5,4.5,1306993015,Schmit,"One of the best IPAs from Oregon (which is saying a lot).		$2 for a 12-oz. can at Full Throttle Bottle in south Seattle--and worth every penny.		Great head on this rosy-orange colored beer. It lets off a strong and unmistakable lychee aroma, which I've smelled on all three separate occasions I've tasted it so far. Flavor has the same lychee up front, with piney/resiny hops backing it up. Carbonation is good and the finish is pleasantly bitter that doesn't linger over-long.		All in all, one great IPA and probably the best thing I've ever drunk out of a can."
678,Caldera IPA,10784,1075,6.1,American IPA,4,3,4,3.5,4,1306940546,beagle75,"Poured from a 12 oz. can into a shaker pint glass.		A: Very clear, light amber color with over one finger of off-white foam head. Heavy lacing remains on the glass, showing striking relief near the top of the glass.		S: Peppery and astringent herbaceous hops suggest dryness, with lesser tropical and citrus fruit also detected.		T: Begins dry, with earthy black pepper that seems to be associated with the aromatic hops from the smell. Esters are barely detectable, blending in with and complementing the hops. The fruit flavors give off a funky tropical quality, like durian. Acidity is restrained--detectable but never distracting. Husky toasted grain becomes more assertive in the middle, and moderate bitterness develops in the finish amidst continuing malt and slightly astringent hops.		M: Medium viscosity, smooth and slightly sticky on the palate, with very low carbonation.		D/O: It seems like many of the IPAs made by the smaller production breweries struggle almost predictably with some facet of the style--all in the pursuit to be unique in order to stand apart from the pack. This contribution from Caldera is fairly unique in its qualities, but it manages to stay appealing. Its abv is on the low side of the normal range for the style, adding to its approachable nature. Look for interesting pepper and off-center tropical fruit, but don't expect anything too extreme--this is a beer that still aims to please."

Poured from can into a pilsner glass. Nice orange color which fades to yellow on the outside of the beer. 1/4 inch head that laced the whole glass. Picture alone, this looks like an amazing beer.	Smell was barely apparent. I tried several times to get any aroma at all. I do pick up a faint aroma of orange, pineapple and other citrus notes. No pine smell at all.	Taste is average. Not anything surprising or breath taking. No real note supercedes the rest. Faint hints of orange and citrus fade to a very faint sign of pine on the end.	I rated the mouthfeel better after reading the abv. For having 6.1%, its very easy to drink.	My overall attitude of this beer is that it is ok. Not a great one, and not a bad one. Then again I have no idea how fresh my sample was."

A little too bitter with an unpleasing aftertaste.	It's good, just not quite ready for the big time. With all the great beers Oregon has to offer the competition is too tough to rate this beer among the best.	If they smooth out the edges with a little balance this can be a great beer."

About what you'd expect from a good IPA :)		S: Very citrusy, lots of grapefruit, lemons, etc..		T: Surprisingly non-bitter. Tastes closer to an APA than an IPA. Nice clean grapefruit with a bit of bitterness on the back end (but not too much).		M: Surprisingly light. Carbonation suits it perfect to keep it crisp. 		O: Overall pretty impressive for a beer I've never heard of. Not too hoppy, not too malty, not too bitter, just does everything pretty well (but not amazingly, admittedly)."

Big pine and grapefruit nose that screams bright hop flavor will follow, and it does. Taste follows the nose with big grapefruit notes that are followed by tangerine, pine, and maybe a slight pineapple at the end. Malt is light, slightly sweet, and lets the hops shine through very nicely. Not aggressively bitter but bitter enough to make you sip it a little slower, not offensive at all. Very drinkable, nicely priced, and always available where I am, making this one a regular for me."

Great lacing stick to the glass. Brew is rich copper/orange color with yellow and red hues. Head is VERY thick and lingers nicely! Head tiers nicely. 		S - WOW. I can smell it from two feet away! Smells like a GREAT IPA. Very rich citrus scent, lots of grapefruit and tangerines. Perhaps a little lime/lemon too. Hop characteristics are like few IPS i've smelled.		T - Buttery smooth on the front side with VERY *slight* bitterness on the backend. One the brew on your tongue is fully oxygenated it get quite bitter. Very unusual grapefruit taste. Very good brew, but a little too bitter for my IPA taste.		M - Amazingly light and fluffy. Perfect carbonation. Creamy and rich mouthfeel that spreads with the brew. The bitterness at the backend slightly bothers me, but would be wonderful with fish, potatoes, steak, or a nice cheese.		O - A very good IPA that drinks wonderfully and smells and looks amazing. It also comes from a can, this makes me VERY happy. I wish I was able to get this brew in CO to take backpacking.		Thanks for a wonderful trade brendaniel!"

At first taste I get a little hop bitterness followed by caramel with a big piney, resinous hop finish. This is a very tasty IPA.		Medium bodied with very bold flavors. This beer leaves behind that resinous, piney hop flavor after the beer has been swallowed.		I really like this beer. It is most certainly a hop lovers delight. It's fairly low ABV could allow one to drink down a few of these in one sitting. However, the price could limit the number of times I try this, at over 16$ for a sixer."

Head retention is pretty good, and there is a lot of lacing left behind on the glass. Aroma is herbal and citrusy hops, along with a bit of sweet malt. Taste is similar to the aroma, it's mostly hops with some sweet malt noticable too. There's also a nice lingering bitter hoppy finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's slick with moderate carbonation.

From can to pint glass		A: Pours a darker caramel color pale with some orange tints to it. Massive khaki tan head due to bad pour on my part but sticky icky lacing fo' sure!		S: Instant pop of the top is burst of sweet mango and tangerine aromas. Candied orange rinds. Is this a friggin orange soda? I cant get over the smells of citrus oils here. Best fruity and floral nose in an IPA I have come across in a while. Better than Flower Power maybe. 		T: Taste is intense hop bitterness that is just danky hops, resiny pine, and blasts of citrus. Grassy and sassy. I love it! Malts hardly detectable at first but the hops do settle down fairly quickly and give way to this sweet caramelly malt goodness. Soft caramel and sweet cracker. Nice bittery dry finish. Delciousness out of a can.		M: Sticky resinous hops do coat the tongue but overall pretty creamy in texture and peppers out the palate on the finish.		D: Pretty damn nice IPA out of a can I must say. Snowboarding, camping, fishing...they all just got even better. More please.		All I got to say is I need to get up to Oregon."

Malt sweetness is also detectable in the nose.		Taste is grassy, piny, spicy. Assertive but balanced, caramel malt is present. Big merit on drinkability, a simple and flavorful IPA. Finishes clean, nice and smooth. This would be a great ""every day"" IPA, but I guess, so would Pliny."
689,Caldera IPA,10784,1075,6.1,American IPA,4,4,4.5,4,4,1304497206,MaltsOfGlory,"The look of this is pretty freaking nice, the coolest part about the look is the contrast between the head and the body. The head is almost completely white, and the body is a reddish, orangey, amber color, it looks more like an amber than an IPA, but the head color and body color look really nice together. I can tell the head is a solid one, it is clearly leaving good lacing, it didn't hang around too long though. If it had better head retention I would probably give this a 4.5, but since that head went a little fast, 4. Nice citrusy hops on the nose, along with a very clean smell. The beer just smells super clean and fresh, like they used really good water or something. You can also pick up a nice malt note in there, it is pretty distant, but for sure there. Maybe some grapefruit in here too, not sure. The smell is very nice though, it smells like a very good IPA. Well on the taste, it for sure has enough hops, it's not a weak IPA, that's for sure. The taste is really just like I detected it would be on the smell, it's really big on the hops, and it has a very small malt note in the back end. Frankly I'm surprised at how much more hop there is than malt, I guess I just haven't had a really good (or hoppy, if you will) IPA in a while. Not super complex other than the basic tastes, but it is super well done none the less. The mouthfeel is also pretty good, nice solid feel to it, not too big, not too small, just right. Drinkability is a little low just because it is so damn bitter, but I can't be upset about that, that just means it's a good beer! Overall a damn good beer, not extraordinarily complex, but a very well done beer, there is really nothing wrong with this beer at all."

A - Pours a clear, dark amber color with a one finger, fluffy off-white color head. The head is sticking around for a really long time. Excellent retention and excellent lacing.		S - This is by far the fruitiest smelling IPA i have ever had the chance of enjoying. Pineapple and mango DOMINATE the aroma. I dont smell any citrus or pine. Some maltiness is pressent, but the fruit dominate the aroma profile for me. 		T - Piny and resiny hop flavors mixed with less prominant citrus and pineapple. The flavors are very crisp and clean. The sweetness that i smelled is not as present as i expected. Very well balanced.		M - Medium bodied with medium carbonation. Well balanced hop bitterness and malt sweetness. Fairly sticky from the resiny hops.		O - A great IPA. The aroma is second to none and it helps that it drinks as well as it smells.

Taste: Muted grassy hops, orange, balanced well with sweet malt and finishes dry.		Mouthfeel: Medium-light feel to it with mild carbonation.		Overall: Not a bad brew overall, but not great either. Checking Caldera's site on this, it claims to have an assertive hop profile and 94 IBUs. I'm thinking this can traveled a long way and sat for quite some time before being sold to me, because I am not picking up much bitterness or hops. Someone could have told me this was a pale ale with IBUs around 50-60, and I would have believed it. Still, it was an enjoyable beer, and I'll be keeping an eye out for others from this brewery."

Big cling in the glass.		Smell- Little bit of crystal malt with some caramel sweet, maybe a pinch of graprefruity IPA'ness.		Taste- A very well done IPA. Malty backbone with a spicy, fruity, candy like chew to it.		Mouth- Medium bodied with a medium carb level. Fruits with a little pepper. Good stuff.		Drink- I will have this again. A good IPA from a can."

S: Floral and citrus hops that lets a bit of malt through for a superb aroma.		T: The malt is well balanced against the citrus and herbal hops. A really well balanced IPA that brings a varied bouquet of hops to the table and supports it well with a robust malt backbone.		M: Mild to moderately carbonated with a bit of hops stickiness.		D: This is a great IPA that presents a powerful hops profile. This is up there with my favorite IPAs, and the boldness of its big bitter taste despite its canned presentation is a refreshing sight. This makes it the perfect beer to take to the beach or on a hike without sacrificing any flavor for portability and convenience. I've finally found a beer to replace Dale's for pure canned hop power!"
701,Caldera IPA,10784,1075,6.1,American IPA,3,3.5,3,2.5,4,1299990272,generalnotsew,I got a nice head on the pour but the coloring is a much lighter and watery looking amber color than that is expected of most IPA's. The smell is pretty nice. Mostly sweet pineapple but the hops aren't that noticeable. Very sugary as well. But I do have to give it points for being pretty strong in the nose even if it isn't showing bitterness. The bitterness is fairly sharp in the front but it fades into a kind of cheapish sweet corn and cereal like lager. Aftertaste also leaves a lot to be desired. Actually after the initial bitterness there really isn't much other flavor besides the corn and more bitterness. Pretty one dimensional. A bit too overcarbonated and kind of leaves a bad feel in your mouth. Well it is easy drinking. I can give it that. Heard a lot of good things about this beer. It failed to impress me. No canned/best by date so who knows how fresh it is. At $12 a six pack this beer is total fail! I didn't even see the price til it rang up and I thought it was a mistake and had to look at the screen to make sure. Even if it was pretty good that price is pretty bad.

Preface, I can recall many a pleasant afternoons spent in SE Portland drinking this at Otto's accompanied by a smoked sausage. 		A- Golden amber color with a whitish head. Not sure if I dropped the can before pouring, but the head was two and half fingers when poured moderately. Reduces to a firm thorough covering the lasts. Plenty of lacing on the glass. No visible carbonation bubbles.		S- Hops! Complex mixture of grapefruit, grassy, and herbal tones. Not much malt. Very very hop forward. 		T- Wish it tasted like it smelled minus the grassy aroma. Bitter at the front and end. I taste white onion throughout. It is quite the hop wallop, but the onion seems to be the main taste (had nothing to eat before tasting, so no lingering food tastes). Minus the onion, I think this would be dead on.		M- Medium body with minimal carbonation. Dry finish on the tongue. Lingers bitter with that onion taste.		D- Still would drink it for nostalgia reasons alone, but it holds up. Perfect for mowing the lawn or a softball game. It is easy to drink."

A bit of resin. Nice balanced malty backbone, toasted, earthy and bitter through and though		M - Weed and resin! Puckers the whole mouth with glorious bitterness and a bit of sweet at the end. Sticky and lingers for a long while		D - This is not your average IPA. This is a hop and bitterness beast. Amazing smells and tastes, but if you are frightened of bitters, stay away.

Appearance: Pours a darker-than-straw honey color, with some hop haze and carbonation visible. Retained about a finger of off-white rocky head. Very true to the style in appearance.		Smell: Nothing overwhelming but nothing off here, either. Hops, citrus, some grassy-floral componenets as well. To me the malts took a back seat, without letting the hops being overwhelming or one-dimensional. Soft-smelling, I would call it.		Taste & mouthfeel: Essentially the same as the nose, with a grapefruit-like flavor as the main culprit. Hop bitterness makes your tongue tingle initially, and the sharp grapefruit levels out into a slight lingering bitterness. The malts are light and toasty but seem distant. Again, a little 'soft' but not one-dimensional. The mouthfeel is extremely crisp and it dries you out on the back end. I consider this a light bodied beer.		Disgustingly drinkable.		Edit to Note: I was just getting over a cold when I tried this, so I will re-review in the future. If this really is as bitter and hop-forward as some of the other reviewers are saying, I will be upping my grade for this beer."

The Caldera is not available in Illinois at this point, so I was excited to try a new West Coast IPA and this was no disappointment. 		APPEARANCE: Brilliant gold-copper in color with a quarter-inch, very homogeneous and bubbly, white head. Not bad retention, as it slowly faded over the course of a minute or so.		SMELL: Pine and floral aromas dominate the smell, but mild malt and grapefruit smells are present as well.		TASTE: This is a hoppy, bitter beer and it is delicious. The hops dominate from start to finish in this beer and balance is a relative term in this case, however, there are enough grapefruit and floral flavors to ensure that the hops don't completely destroy the palate. Very dry all the way through, particularly in the aftertaste. 		MOUTHFEEL: Well carbonated, the Caldera sparkles from start to finish while it dries and bitters the whole way through. 		DRINKABILITY: This is what a West Coast IPA is supposed to be all about - bold, bitter and biting. This is not a beginner beer, it is for the seasoned hop head who can appreciate every IBU packed into this brew."

S: Pine hops and a lot of caramel malts.		T: Pretty fair balance between the hops and malts. Nice amount of hops upfront and then a lot of bready malts with a slightly burnt flavor to them.

A - Pours a clear, dark orangey amber color with a fluffy finger of cream colored foam. Head has veyr good stying power and after descending, leaves behind thick streaks of lacing.		S - Lots of pine up front mixed with some pineapple, mango and grapefruit. Lightly caramalized malt presence...other than that, almost entirely hops in the nose.		T - Tight, crisp hop bitterness. Piney hop flavors mixed with less prominant citrus component. Stronger malt base than the aroma indicates with lots of breadiness and toasted malt. Very nicely balanced overall.		M - Light/medium bodied with a crisp and tingly medium/medium-high carbonation level. Estery fruitiness mixed with a clean hop bitterness linger past the swallow. A bit sticky and resiny from the hops.		D - A really good IPA. Well brewed with excellent balance and multilayered flavors. Could easy stick with this one throughout a session.

Thick spotted lacing climbing down various sides of the glass.		S - A large upfront hit of citrus with some pine notes hiding behind some sweet caramel malt essence.		T - Right of the bat, a major hit of citrus with a follow up of some semi-sweet flavor (pineapple). Mildly sweet malty transition to the finish with a late note of Piney Hop(s) and lemon.		M - Nice body, slightly above average in carbonation, but seems to be missing a little in the transition from introduction to finishing edge, I suppose the ""carryover.""		D - By far the best canned IPA I've had to date, especially for the price. Certainly drinkable and pretty hoppy. I like the start and finish but was left wanting just a little more in the middle. Overall a pretty decent beer and easy to enjoy as a ""session"" beer.		My prescription: Get it if you can and try a few. It runs with the common theme of West Coast IPA's though IMHO it's just slightly weaker in overall flavors and finish."

I don't like coconut anything really, but the wife does, and she got this beer, so I'm glad I ended up sampling it because I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. Smelled of--you guessed it--coconut, and milk chocolate, with some smooth roasted malts in the background. Very smooth on the tongue, taste of dark malts, and chocolate coated macaroons....which again, I do not like, but in beer form it translated so well. Sweet, but not overbearingly so, and then slightly bitter in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel was smooth, but not quite full-bodied; it was definitely a porter and not a stout. Very good overall."

Definite citrus (orange?) hop impressions here. Pleasant.		Dry taste, moderate bitterness, full hop mouthfeel. Easy to drink. Not overpowering hop presence, but good nonetheless, gives it the delicate and on point treatment moreso than just simplistic bitter brutality. Crystal and caramel malt seem to be kicking it here.

It was a little dark on the patio outside, but it certainly had an orange glow and appropriate lacing. Aroma had lavender, clementine, grapefruit pith, scented geranium and thai basil exploding from the glass. Delightfully potent hops without the poison-like bitterness or tannin. Don't get me wrong, I like big beers, but drinkability for a pitcher with friends is crucial and this fit the bill."

Thirty delicious beers on tap and this was the first I tried (hey, I'm a Southern Oregon man, plus my girlfriend wanted something a little fruity). The orange flavor was vibrant and quite simply amazing. Sweet, but not too sweet, and not overly bitter. The hops and orange flavor played very well together.

Pretty sure I've had this before...		Here's the description from Caldera's website for this year-round offering:	""A conundrum in the world of beer styles. This ale does not fit any conventional beer style. Orange in color, this beer has hop characteristics of oranges and tangerines. Grist: Premium Two Row, Crystal; Hops: Amarillo, Cascade, Horizon; Original gravity: 1.052; Alcohol by volume: 5.4%.""		A: Beautiful, slightly hazy honey-orange color. Light to moderate fast-rising carbonation. Topped with a creamy, off-white head, about 1-1/2 fingers, gently fading. Good lace.		S: Malty caramel, a touch sweet. A piercing hop sting - definitely orange/citrus-smelling. 		T: More toffee-maltiness than I'd expected, but offset with that 'orange' pith taste the hops contribute. What starts sweeter ends more on the side of bitterness. Good flavors and nicely balanced overall.		M: Creamy, medium mouthfeel, carbonation seems a little light. Ends with a little sticking malt and a slightly metallic hop bite on the back of the tongue. This analogy may sound weird, but it felt like a quarter was being pressed down on my tongue...		D: For a beer without a definitive style to grade against, I can really just say that - yes - it was enjoyable and - yes - I would get it again."

Nice looking orangy amber ale with a tiny white head that lasts no time, some lace left.	Aroma is pleasant but nothing special ..of hops and malts with a touch or orange peel zest.	The taste was exhilarating to start with the hops blending well with the orange peel falavours but after a while it bacame dullish,but themalts held throughout.

The orange in the name is certainly reflected in the taste and nose as well as the colour.		I found this on-tap at Kelly's Olympian and certainly hasn't been there for more than a fortnight.		This brew works well. It is dry and hoppy as the name suggests, and the orange doesn't ruin this by making it too sweet. Think peel rather than juice.		It is surprisingly refreshing and drinkable for such a dry beer. Not frou-frou."

Well, that's a tall order. With that said, this reminded me of the beers I drank in Germany, when I favored the crisp, clean taste of a cold pilsener. The color is straw yellow and crystal-clear. The smell is light and floral, and the taste is crisp, malty-sweet and lightly hopped. In addition, the hops hit you then disappear. The mouthfeel is light, as a pilsener should be.

The smell is mild and fruity, as much from the dry hopped cascade(?) as the passion fruit it seems. Not bad, but more restrained then I expected.		The taste is bitter sweet, a little grainy, not much hops and a touch of passionfruit. Basically drinks like a pale ale, not as fruity or tart as I was expecting. While I didn't want a daiquiri, I could have used more of the ""real passion fruit puree"" that this was made with. 		The mouthfeel was quite nice, creamy and very light without being watery. 		This was pretty drinkable, mainly due to the light body and borderline bland taste. I, however, like my beers have to some punch to them taste wise, and didn't find that here."

Darker than I would have expected for an IPA. One-finger tan head that sticks around for a while and leaves a smattering of lacing around the glass.		The first aroma is definitely from the hops - piney and grassy. But, the predominant aroma as I go down the glass is the malt. Definite predominant caramel and maple malt aroma.		Well, I'm a little disappointed in the flavor. The hops are definitely taking a back seat to the malt. No doubt, there are hops in the blend, but the malt is more forward, so it does follow the aroma fairly closely.		The mouthfeel is of a medium thickness.

With obvious nods from the ruby color, this has a much more roasty character to the malt- toasted grain and apricot aromas- while the bigtime hops add a lot of floral, grapefruity tones as well as a faint touch of cheesy pungency. Unfortunately, with the darker roast on the malt making a bigger overall impression on the aroma profile, the beer seems to be having an identity crisis- losing complexity in the process.		The palate mostly mirrors the nose, with the bigger malt character bumping elbows with the hoppiness. Starts medium bodied and creamy, with an instant blast of hop bitterness- flavors of apricot, toasted grain and red grapefruit- while the toastiness and bitterness roll right on through the finish.		If there's such a style as a Red IPA, then maybe this clears the bar. But as a standard IPA, this completely misses for me. Plainly stated, IPAs should scream hops, and I really don't like it when the malt tries to turn it into a screaming match. That extra roastiness just overpowered any sort of subtlty to the drink."

Lacing is minimal once the head dissipates. Doesn't look bad.		Smell - Some citrus hops. Not overwhelming. There's a background smell that reminds me of homebrew. Like a musty smell.		Taste - Taste is initially hoppy, but not all that hoppy. Behind that is a nutty maltiness, maybe with a hint of spiciness. Finally, however, is an awful grassy bitterness that renders the beer just about undrinkable. It coats the mouth and doesn't go away.		Mouthfeel - Medium bodied with medium carbonation. After the hops and malt it dries out quickly, leaving the bitterness just hanging. It emphasizes the awful flavor.		Overall - The first half of the flavor is decent, but the finish is very bad.

A: Clear, light reddish-amber color with one finger of lofty off-white foam head. Moderate lacing remains on the glass.		S: A faint combination of floral and piney hops that also feature some toast and mixed fruit.		T: Begins off-dry, with malt-focused flavors of toasted bread and caramel that increase in sweetness. Hop aromatics are floral but muted. Astringency emerges in the middle as acidity peaks at a moderate level. The finish possesses diminishing qualities encountered earlier, mainly floral hops and esters, with moderate bitterness.		M: Medium viscosity, slightly sticky on the palate, with moderate carbonation.		D: If a brewery that cans most of their product puts a beer in a bottle, does that mean it's special? In this case, the answer is no. It is a very malt-focused IPA that features an underwhelming smell and some rough flavor edges. Ultimately Caldera's standard IPA wins out, with this beer as a hybrid IPA/DIPA that just lacks characteristic abv and hop intensity. This mis-step does little to shake my confidence in Caldera, considering the mastery shown in other beers such as the barrel-aged Mogli or their rauch bock. I do have to question the source of their interest in this particular recipe."

There is a bitter and at the same time sour aftertaste to the finish, and the bitter portion of that will linger from some time after the beer is gone.

Smell - The pine and citrus here is very tight and wrapped in a malty toasted base. The hops are very raw and fresh.		Taste - The malt gets bigger at the taste but the hops are still, well, hopping. The malt adds some sweetness here, maybe caramel, and the pine actually seems bigger as well which is the exact opposite of most every other AIPA.

Review is from notes on 10/16/10.		A: Pours a dark gold, bordering on amber with a tint of orange into a snifter. A half finger khaki head vanishes quickly, leaving a washboard film pattern on top. Thin, straight lines of carbonation move slowly up the glass. Small dotty lacing with a couple of arches is moderately sticky. 		S: I am not sure when this was bottled, but caramel malts are edging out the Centennial hops in my nose. Sweeter citrus notes of orange and lime and a dry, bitter hop character exist in the background. A hint of spiciness is also evident. 		T: The malt to hop balance is better than I thought it would be. Caramel malts are the dominant flavor, but citrus hops and nice dry pine and grassy hoppiness on the finish provide a counterpoint to the malts. 		M: This is a solid medium feel for an IPA with a coating sensation from the copious malt presence. The finish is a drying hop suck on the sides of my palate. 		D: HK is not my ideal IPA with the citrus hop notes a bit of an afterthought in the taste, but it is still pretty tasty. I do not think I would seek this out again, but I did enjoy drinking it. Oh yeah, the label is amazing. I love the little hop men knocking on the door to the cosmos - classic."

It also smells strongly of caramel. There is a bit of a grassy hop smell as well.		It tastes much like the smell. It initially tastes strongly of orange and other citrus fruits. An earthy slightly floral hop flavor is also present. A substantial amount of caramel sweetness balances the beer. A bitter aftertaste is present. This is a pretty generic tasting DIPA.		The carbonation is moderate low.		The drinkability is ok. I can finish this bottle easily but the heavy caramel malt quality of this beer would limit how much of the beer I would want to drink. 		Overall this is a pretty good beer. But there really is nothing about it. It is an average example of the DIPA. It is enjoyable but it seems uninspired."

Appearance: Split two ways and poured into a large snifter. The beer pours a hazy copper/orange with a small head that recedes pretty quickly. A small ring of lacing made of large bubbles is left after the head recedes. Some scattered streams of carbonation are visible in the glass.		Smell: I was expecting more in the way of hop aroma, but the bottle did sit a while, so perhaps that has something to do with it. There is some fairly decent citrus and pine notes, as well as some grainy malt aroma and a bit of something musty in the background. There is also a touch of spice present; almost reminiscent of a saison-type influence.		Taste: There is definitely more bitterness than the smell leads on. The flavor is pretty well balanced with a decent malt profile. There's not a ton of complexity here, but it is a pretty decent representation of the style.		Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied, creamy texture, with some biting pine notes. Fairly dry finish, and there's definitely some lingering bitterness there.		Drinkability: Pretty easy drinker, but a little more on the malty side than your typical IPA. Definitely enjoyable though; I'd certainly reach for another."

Initially after the pour I took in whiffs of pine, and citrus, but after letting it settle I got more biscuit and sweet malts.		Tastes like it smelled, initial hop blast that singes the tongue, then it subsides to give a biscuit/malt based finish. Overall, I'd say it tasted like a hoppy barleywine.

Aroma was hoppy to a degree, but wasn't anything to write home about. The appearance was like a 4.25 and the aroma 3.75, so it all evens out.		Intense bitterness when you drink this. Seemed to be chinook, cascade and centennial combo, maybe with some willamette's thrown in for good measure. At times the bitterness just overshadows anything going on. Really, I can't see this being worth delving into the bottle world, it doesn't add anything that I can't get in the can for an ipa. Would have to lean on grapefruit the most to describe the hop and bitterness feel (moreso) in this beer.		Comes off a little more like a PacNW ipa than west coast.

A - Hazy auburn, pours with a huge pillowy three fingers of head with nice retention. Rings of lacing down the glass. Very nice looking.

D - ABV isn't too high, but the aroma and taste just aren't doing it for me. I doubt I'd reach for another.

Appears quite oily and dense for the style and the carbonation looks like it's struggling to escape. Lots of foamy lacing.		S: Citrusy grapefruit aroma and lots of pine. There is a faint sweetness in the backdrop, but the overall nose seems a little dampened.		T: Bitter, grapefruity hops crash the palate, balanced by a touch of bready, slightly sweet malts. The hops are powerful here but they work well against the honey sweetness. There's some orange and lemon zest in there, and the alcohol has a warming effect halfway through each sip. As the beer warms, grassy, earthy, almost floral flavors can be detected. The beer finishes pleasantly bitter and dry.		M: This is a fairly rich, chewy beer and could pass for a DIPA in its texture. The carbonation is perfect for this style and nicely washes away each sip. The taste is much more vibrant than the nose, and I wonder if that's due in part to its oily, full-bodied composition.		D: This is a total hop-bomb, but as your palate adjusts to the aggressively bitter hop profile you'll find this brew quite balanced. I noticed myself drinking faster as I was writing this review.		Notes: Overall, quite impressive. This could easily pass for a California IPA and could stand up against some of the better known hop monsters coming out of SoCal. I'm really particular about IPA's and fairly skeptical about unknown renditions, but after finishing a pint I'm surprising satisfied.This is the first offering I've sampled from Caldera and they've passed my IPA test with flying colors, so they'll be on my radar."

The palate is likewise suffused with whole-cone dank hemp-y goodness with hints of orange zest, grapefruit, and an almost cedar-like woody/earthy element that is at least as much a contribution of the hardy (hearty?) malt backbone as it is derived from the hops - an unapologetically NW-style IPA, malt forward with a suggestion of wet stones and cocoa in the bitter, fruity finish. 		Medium-full bodied, oily, almost sticky mouthfeel with moderate carbonation and a touch of warmth from the alcohol. 		Some astringency in the finish makes it a sipper, and overall I think it does better with food (grilled salmon comes immediately to mind) than all on its lonesome.		Not as well balanced as their regular canned IPA, but that isn't the point of this series."

One finger creamy white head, medium-fast dissipation with some lacing. Reddish amber clear body, no visible carbonation. The nose is spicy, piny hops and caramel malts, battling for attention, nicely balanced. Taste is a bit of malty sweetness upfront, firm malt backbone in the middle, and a lingering fairly bitter resiny hop finish. Mouthfeel is pretty full, not much effervescence, fairly dry, resiny and a bit sticky. There is some pretty serious hoppiness in play here, not overly bitter. Looking forward to comparing this with the bottled version."

Upon pouring this ipa i saw a hazy amber beer with a thick dull white head and smelled hops. A goodstart to an ipa. The smell is of citrus-grapefruit, earthy, and a hint of pine. The taste is pungent grapefruit, battling pine, and subtle sweet malt flavor. Not the most complex beer but all the same good."

Sweet malt follows through.		Medium bodied with a slightly chewy, tacky mouthfeel. A bit grippy.		Plump malt and pithy tangerine lead off the palate. Pine-rubbed grapefruit and a firm bitterness step forward. Plenty of dank, herbaceous resins. Almost woodsy.		Finishes with a lingering, drying bitterness that balances the sweet malt and plenty of chewy resins.		Tasty one. On the malty side of IPA's, and the nose could be ramped up, but plenty of dankness and pine dew to go around."

Smell - The nose is of heavy caramel and malt, slightly bitter grapefruit, hops, other citrus such as orange peel, and slight piney and floral scents.		Taste - More balanced than I would have thought. A hoppy citrus burst up front that becomes more bitter the more you drink the beer as it warms. This is then oddly encapsulated by a heavy malty, caramel backbone. So I guess the overall product in sum is balanced but in reality as this beer warms up there are two extremes to it.		Mouthfeel - Moderate body, oily slick hops, medium carbonation.		Drinkability - I'll put this in the ""somewhat"" category. Knowing I have a Blind Pig waiting for me after this makes me realize that this is not as drinkable as one would expect. Now, give me 10 Blind Pigs in a row and I will still ask for more. They are right around the same ABV but this beer just doesn't leave me craving more of it. Not bad, but nothing spectacular to be honest."

Strong pink grapefruit, cantaloupe rind, with the strong crystal malt flavour, bordering on amber ale.		M: Fairly light-bodied in this style, soft carbonation, moderate aftertaste.

The aroma is very complex with plenty of pine and citrus hops, but also some toasty roasty malt character that is not overpowering and quite nice. The flavor follows the same path. Very bitter with a huge citrus and pine punch to the taste buds, as well as a groin kick of roasted and caramel malt. I have to say, I thought this was just a normal IPA, but it seems to be leaning a bit more towards an American strong ale/Black IPA in flavor. Astringency and bitterness fight a battle royal in my mouth, and I am lucky enough to have a front row seat. The mouthfeel is on the full side of medium, and has one of those sticky/dry finishes that are common in beers of this gravity and hop load. Not the most drinkable for style, but still goes down pretty easily. I really like this, and am glad it comes in a bomber."

Very nice head, but the body's a bit dark and murky for an IPA. 		Smell is skunky, some citrus, earthy spice too. Nice floral sweetness, but not the blistering hops I expected from the label. 		Taste is pretty citrusy, spicy hops, but not to strong. Big bready malt backbone, moderate bitterness, definitely on the malty side or an IPA, more like a hoppy amber or pale ale. Marketed as such, I'd have scored it higher. I don't really like big malty IPAs. 		Mouthfeel is slick and oily, there's a thinness to this, almost cask like, in spite of the chewiness of the malt. 		Drinkability is okay, but with a name like Hopportunity Knocks, I was expecting a much hoppier brew. This one is a new release and I bought it from a cooler so I'm sure it's pretty fresh.

This is not a beginner's ale, so if you are new to the micro game, this may not be the beer for you. Since this is a Caldera brew, it could EASILY pass for an IPA. Overall drinkability is great.

I've never quaffed a stout quite like this one. Huge chocolate/spice aroma, nice creamy medium-full body with moderate carbonation and little lace left on the pint glass. Fabulous roasty, sweet, chocolate, spice (cinnamon, nutmeg?) taste that just hits the spot. Not particularly hoppy, but an adequate bite from the alcohol, roast barley/black patent/spice. A great balance of flavors that is complex, yet seamless.

The similarity in the beers visibly was uncanny. It was a solid opaque black graced with a regal quaff of foam.		The aroma was tart and slightly smokey. Mild, but partly due to the competition with the fancy pipe smoke from the guy sitting next to us.		The taste was astounding. Its rare that you stumble across something that can easily replace a standard with such ease. Nothing in this beer is overstated, but the smooth combination of dry, tart and peat, with a slight fruitiness in just the right amount for a sweet compliment.		This is a stellar seasonal, and I hope they keep the recipe. I would not change a single thing. There seems to be confusion over what this beer is. Caldera's ""site"" says that it changes by season.

Medium dry mildly bitter finish. A bit astringent on the palate. Not sweet and cloying like most American Ambers. I think this is a bit on the bitter side for the style.

The head is pretty much totally white, where as the body is a standard amber color, there are hughes of orange in here as well, the beer is see through is some areas, but for the most part completely non transparent. it looks ok, nothing special. The smell leads me to think that I'm not going to like the beer, it's all malt on the smell, almost no hops to speak of, and an amber ale should have some hops in there. Not only that, but the malt smells like it's the kind of malt I really don't like, the malt that tastes like it smells before you even brew the beer, just a complete grain taste. We will see, but the smell doesn't give me high hopes. Well on the first taste I took I couldn't really detect any hops, and frankly I thought the beer was extremely boring on the first taste. However, on the second and third sips, the hops are coming out a little bit more. The malts are for sure not too bad, they aren't really the kind of bad taste I was detecting on the smell. This is a very drinkable beer, and not bad by any means, but I frankly wish there was more taste to it. On some tastes this beer deserves a 4, but on others it deserves a 3.5, so I dunno. The taste just isn't as bold and powerful as it could be, but it is crisp and refreshing, and it does have some nice flavors to it. The mouthfeel isn't too bad, a little thin, but it does have some girth to it, not too bad. Overall a good beer, not amazing, but good. Frankly I can't find anything too wrong with it other than the smell, but I guess it just wasn't hitting on all cylinders for me, for some reason. I could totally understand and respect this beer getting a A- from someone else, it just wasn't doing that for me today."

Pours a bright clear copper hue with fluffy eggshell white head of 2 cm foaming up. Fades at a steady pace leaving some large lattice on the glass and creating some large craters in the foam. Relatively quickly gets to a sturdy surface layer.	Aroma is some grainy malt and hints of corn husk and caramel with some grassy hops and just a hint of pine sap.	First sip reveals an average body with very mild, smooth, rolling carbonation. Texture is soft and silky on each sip.The beer really caresses my palate.	 The flavor is as nose advertises with some grainy malt going to caramel. Then come the hops, grassy and pine again come into play and bitter up my mouth a little, but actually give back to a husky grainy finish.	No hint of ABV which is good since the can says 5.6 and I shouldnt really be able to get that anywhere.	A nice easy drinking session beer in a can.	I like it!"

Smell: Faint aroma with some piney hops, a little bit of malt, and a hint of iced tea.		Taste: Rich biscuit malty taste with a fair bit of caramel as well. The middle is nutty and the beer finishes up semi-sweet and with quite a punch of piney hops.		Mouthfeel: Light with a fair amount of carbonation, but not overly done. Crisp and clean. 		Drinkability: Easily drinkable and very sessionable. Could have a few easily. 		Final Notes: A very good amber ale - lots of biscuity, caramelly goodness but the hoppy back end is also a pleasant surprise.

Very nice. 	T: The hops make a greater appearance in the flavor, but the wide, sweetish malt still remains the focal point. It's nicely balanced between malt and hops; and a very firm bitterness anchors it. It finishes drying with notes of leafy and grassy hops as the malt erodes from the palate.

Aroma is pine bark, grapefruit, perfumy-dusty barley (a bit like Napa Smith Amber Ale but much better, more subtle and well-rounded), plus hint of pineapple.		Taste is basically a very good, balanced, firm, well-rounded, and characterful interpretation of standard west-coast style.

Smells hoppy, especially from an amber ale, I guess from Oregon though that's not too crazy. Very floral and grapefruity, slightly piney.

Pours nicely out of the squat can with no canning date. Surprisingly hazy red, I guess I just assumed this would be hard-filtered. Smells like Nicole Kidman would if she was hopped, malted, & stuffed into a can. Brilliant balance. 		Ashland Amber opens with a malty bang. Hard on comes an assortment of fall nuts, sans salt, & do they have staying power. The acorns cling tenaciously to the palate. I'll not be surprised if squirrels claw their way through the siding, drywall, & fridge door to get into these cans. Light hopping, eyeful of bitter, pepper. Perhaps one of the thickest, chewiest ambers I've had, this could easily pass into brown, or almost porter, territory.

It's a nice drinkable beer in certain places, but when that is is beyond me. That's the problem though...when is a mostly malty beer without a sipper level of flavor the right beer for the time?

Pours tawny amber brown (Yuengling-ish?) with a poofy, rocky, eggshell-tan head that dissipates slowly and leaves a bit of lace. Decent look.		Smell is a sucker punch in the nostrils. Not sure what I was expecting from this brew, but the nose was a big surprise. Overhwelmingly bitter and floral, with caramel sweetness singing backup. Maybe I should start believing some of the hype about cans preserving the beer so well.		As surprising as the pungency of the smell was the incongruity of the flavor profile. Just plain uninteresting in contrast to the huge nose- a dash of floral hops, not a ton but enough to outweigh the barely-there malt backbone. Out of balance and generally weak.

Aroma - bread dough, caramel, apple butter, raw sugar, cocoa and some slight citrus. Smells great. I can't wait to move on to the best part of all of this.		Taste - big malty, biscuity, bready sweetness hits the palate immediately. This may be a simple recipe but it sure has been perfected. This has the perfect balance of maltiness and some citrus hops to balance things out. The malt profile is something I am really enjoying, I'm not sure how best to describe it. I'd have to say its somewhere between honey butter and brown sugar cinnamon Pop-Tarts. Well, maybe not that sweet but it is surely delicious. 		Overall - great amber ale, one that I could definitely enjoy in multiple amounts. I love the flavor that this imparts and the great balance that it has with the PNW hops used. Amber Ales may not be my favorite style but this is proof that I could love any beer if its brewed well. 		Would I buy more of it? - absolutely.

A - a ruby colored ale, excellent clarity w/ 3fingers of light beige cap w/ mix of bubbles sized large and tiny. The lace clings very well and retention is good. The color reminds me of cranberry juice which is attractive to look at in the light		S - A sweet toasted grainy odor w/ light fruitiness and berry-like yeast ester w/ a mild hop aroma and slight caramel notes w/ gentle vegetal aroma		M - a moderately carbonated brew w/ mild bitterness and gentle sweetness. The texture has light toasted and spice aspects w/ dry finishing medium body overall		T - the flavor is relatively biscuity upfront and has subtle pine notes from the hops w/ light creamy caramel malt taste. There is a gently fruity element from the yeast which allows the toasted grain note to carry over and seems to be the focus from midpoint on. the toast or roasted notes are the focus w/ mild herbal and the fruity quality adding contrast. The spice tinges mellow and a very light citrus in the hops comes out when warmer w/ another layer of flavor unfolding. The contrast makes the amber very balanced but seems to lean toward malt ever so slightly w/ strong biscuit taste until the semi-dry finish		D - A solid beer in every way, very good representation of the style w/ satisfying drinkability. I would drink this with barbecue or meatloaf. The drinkability is good and I would look for this again I Can guarntee that (wink, wink)"

Pour nets an inch of cream or light tan head crowning a crystal clear medium amber body. Decent retention and lace. The aroma hits the nostrils with the same blend of hops that is familiar to me from their pale ales, lots of resiny pine character. Second to that is a lightly nutty caramel malt element. Taste has a mild sweetness which turns into a crisp resinous hoppiness. Caramel or nougaty malt balance pops up in the midpalate as well, but the finish splits nicely between malt and full on hops. High level of hops for an amber, actually very close to the pales, but I like this better with the malt balance. Medium thick body with a creamy medium carbonation.

Now, for those may be arriving late to today's program, already well in progress, I not only review the beers, but I also transcribe the verbiage so that you do not have to. 		I thought that Ska was very clever: It's [Modus Hoperandi] label read: ""Walk, Kite, Recycle, Hide, Seek, Plant, Recycle, Grow, Shower, HHH, Tube, Recycle."" 		But now, from this one's exterior: "" 'Live Product. Keep Cool. Just Like You."" Yeah, man. How many times have my students heard me say, ""Be cool, baby. Be real cool.""? Innumerable. A ring around the neck read ""Go Biking ... Go Rafting ... Go CANS! ... Go Skiing ... Go Fishing ... Go Snowboarding ... www.calderabrewing.com"". 		It reminds me of the joke of the financially strapped male children looking for something to do on a hot summer's day. They pool their limited resources and send one of their number to the local grocer's, only to have him return with a box of tampons. Incredulous at this purchase, one of them inquires as to his choice. His response: ""Well, the box reads, 'With this product, you can go swimming, camping, fishing and a whole host of fun activites'."" Har!		Yeah, me, I'm going to skip all of that fun stuff with the exception of ""Go CANS!"" Here we go, CANS, here we go!		A friend of mine in the industry remarked that he feels that the days of generic ""Amber"" beers have passed. I disgree, but let's see how this stacks up.		The finger-and-a-half of head was light-tan with good retention. Remember that ""Live Product"" jazz? Well, it had a slight haze to its deep-amber color suggestive of the presence of yeast. CAN-conditioned?!? Holy Drop the Corks and Cages, Batman! Gee, the nose smelled nothing like an amber of yore. Instead, I got a whiff of piney hops, a scent of malty sweetness, even a slight black pepper smell. Mouthfeel was medium to full with a caramel-malt taste that I would expect on the tongue. The finish, however, was both piney and peppery on the extreme, lingering finish. Initially, I got the same caramel sweetness, but it became overwhelmed. Yow! How many more CANs of this do I have left? Somebody said that they have distribution in MD ... Bye!"

Its recent availability in cans provides a welcome addition to their two other canned ales, this one in a colorful display of purple and green on silver. Ashland walks on the dark side of amber and is built on a core alt structure. Its doughy aroma corkscrews through piecrust and malt sweetness while the taste has candied caramel with no more than balancing hops. Good clean fun.

The beer decants into one of my fancy-schmancy Sam Adams pint glasses with a brilliant copper hue, fair head formation, fair retention, and with some mild lacing. Great color and clarity.		Aromas of biscuity maltiness and caramel-toffee prevail with only the lightest hint of herbal hop aroma. Simple understated fruity esters help to add variety to the aroma without bullying. A simple malty aroma.		Flavors of caramel and toffee prevail along with soft butterscotch and sorgum comming into the finish. Again, biscuit sweetness and herbal hops make a direct transition from the aroma to flavor. Malty flavored but also a lot of unresolves sweetneess. Fruity notes here and there help with the complexity but keep the flavors from becomming as clean as they could be.		A bit disjointed in texture because of the unattenuated sugars leaving a film on the mouth. But also shooting for dryness with the sharp bittering hops which cause too much of a bite going past the throat. Still malty throughout with grain flavors and textures late.		Again a nice but ordinary Amber. The hop bitterness doesn't seem to be supported with the pleasant hop flavor or aroma, and allows the hops to bite too much. Those who like sweeter, English-style ales may find this one appealing. Reminds me a lot of Anerson Valley Boont Amber.		Thanks BlueOkie!"

The look and sound of the pour suggests that the mouthfeel will be excellent. Three fingers of thick and creamy foam sit atop the beer and look damn good while doing so. Large sheets of Swiss cheese-like lace stick to the glass.		The nose has a bit too much toasted-nutty-earthy malt for my liking, but then that's what makes Ashland Amber an amber ale rather than an APA. The Cascade and Galena hops aren't as prominent as they are in this brewery's Pale Ale and IPA, but then that's what makes Ashland Amber...		Leave it to Caldera to give Ashland Amber more hops than beer of this style usually sees. Maybe that's why I like their stuff so much. Malt (pale and crystal) has not been slighted. It tastes and feels like there's a considerable amount of barley present, especially for the ABV.		Specifics include steely caramel, roasted peanuts, bitter black tea leaves and a prodigious shaving of grapefruit peel. The beer is balanced in terms of malt flavor vs. hop flavor, but bitterness supercedes sweetness at all points along the way. This is well-crafted beer that is a pleasure to drink.		All things considered, the mouthfeel really is excellent, as the visual and auditory cues said it would be. It's full and lush for the style and the ABV, which makes it the highlight of an already enjoyable experience. Hey guys, can you teach other brewers how to do what you do?		Although I'd take Caldera Pale Ale and Caldera IPA over Ashland Amber any day of the week, this is a wonderfully hoppy amber ale that just about any craft beer lover should enjoy. I would dearly love to have easy access to these brews."

Poured from the can into a pint glass...		Appearance: For an amber, the color seems off as it is just a pretty plain coppery color with a nice, clear body -- I guess I would expect at least some ruby-esque highlights in there, if not a strong amber body...; light carbonation; one finger slightly off-white head that fades to a nice thick skim and very sparse lacing that's very thin.		Smell: Mild, rassy smelling hoppy aroma with some lightly toasted malts; something seems amiss in the nose though and it's got a bit of rotted vegetative scent that reminds me of cabbage. Not a good start, but there have been other times where I've smelled something similar in ambers and haven't been let down by the flavor so I'm optimistic.		Taste: Mostly getting the toasty malts and some of the mildly bitter hop presence, but not much else overall it's very mild... Not bad, but I have definitely had much more flavorful ambers that rate much higher than this.		Mouthfeel: Body is thin and water and a little flat; finsih is wet and is like drinking malt flavored water. 		Drinkability: Overall, it's not hard to drink, but there's not much reason to do so. The flavors are mild and meek, the body is super watery and doesn't offer much, so I don't feel I will be drinking this again."

Appearance: Pours a light toasty amber with some coppery highlights. The liquid is clear and supports a 1/2 finger thin, white foamy head with weak, filmy lacing by tons of carbonation bubbles. 		Smell: Light malt iwth a hint of floral hops and not much more. Disappointing.		Taste/Mouthfeel: Taste with a little bit of malt, sweet grains, lots of water and lots of meh - nothing special here to talk about. Feel is weak, watery and thin. 		Drinkability: Not so much when you consider it tastes like a bad macro."

This retains down into a big creamy dollop, which leaves a sticky latticework of lacing back. The aroma is very fresh, spicy, and floral smelling (maybe a touch of more herbal qualities as well), with some fuller notes of tropical fruits and bready malts mixing in nicely. 		The taste starts with a light-moderate spicy bitterness with a solid backbone of citrus and toasted caramel imparting a sharp tang, before fading into a lingering dry and spicy feel. The hops profile that is present really is all about the spice. The mouthfeel is lighter-medium bodied with a VERY easy carbonation in the mouth. Maybe a bit too easy. While it's not quite watery, it does appear to be a bit thin in spots. Not enough to really hurt the quaffable nature of this though. 		I liked this. One of the more fuller flavored and easy drinking Ambers that I've had recently. This was another solid canned offering form Caldera."

A few nubs of lace jut up the side of the pint glass. Sweet malts and distant hops rise to the nose. Typical, subtle, not great, not bad. Taste involves a little spice and hops up front. Some malts exist in the middle. A light-bodied brew that works well for me at the moment, and the cans sure would come in handy in a lot of situations."

Pours a clear radiant amber color with a fizzy off-white head that quickly dissolves into some wispy remnants. The aroma has biscuit malts, some brown sugar and some very faint hop scents. It has a lot of caramel malt up front with some hops on the end to round out the flavor. Its a light bodied beer with plenty of carbonation.

The head seemed sort of thin, with a lot of tiny little bubbles stacked like shipping peanuts. It didn't have that dense frothiness that I enjoy seeing. 		Toasty malts, along with a strong and sharp, but very herbal, hop aroma. 		More toasted malts along with a lot of sweet caramel. The hop flavor is very tea like, not giving strong citrus characteristics. Full bodied, with maybe slightly below average carbonation. 		I feel like this one could almost be called an Irish Amber Ale just from the flavor characteristics, especially from the hops. It's certainly a unique Amber Ale, especially one coming from the east coast. Rather than a load of sharp citrus, there is a softer herbal quality. Recommended."

Mouthfeel is very nice, smooth, full, and nice mellow carbonation.		Overall, an excellent beer.

Taste, decadent, yummy chocolate integrates well, one of the best barrel flavors I've experienced from oak spirals v. the barrel itself.

Second only to the Old Growth Imperial Stout. I'd venture to say also that this is one of the best Porters I've had in a long time. The beer is close to black in color a thin brown head. The nose has hints of milk chocolate, bourbon, vanilla and oak. In my opinion that is the best nose composition a porter can have. The beer has a medium body and mild carbonation. As it moves across the pallet a strong flavor of dark chocolate hits your tongue with light hints of coffee and bittering acids. Caldera is known for their love of hops and this beer is no different but the hops add to the beers complex flavor profile. This beer could only be better if it had a fuller body and more vanilla and bourbon notes on the pallet. I loved this beer and would recommend it to any dark beer lover."

Draft pour into a dubbel goblet at the Caldera tasting room in Ashland.		A: Uniformly opaque black, with almost one finger of beige foam head. Moderate lacing remains on the glass.		S: Very sweet chocolate milk dominates the smell, with some vanilla and bourbon adding complexity.		T: Toffee, dark fruit, and vanilla to start with bourbon and bittersweet chocolate emerging later. The finish is smooth and full with bourbon. Bourbon flavor deftly asserts itself without being overpowering or intrusive. The presence of alcohol is also handled well here because alcohol flavors are not detectable.		M: Medium viscosity with low to moderate carbonation. This beer is very smooth and gently warming on the palate. While a heavier texture would not be out of place here, nothing about the mouthfeel of this beer is wrong.		D: This beer is both drinkable and delicious. Despite its spirit-infused imperial pedigree, the palate is not fatigued over the course of drinking a glass. Compared to a Ballast Point bourbon barrel-aged Victory at Sea sampled recently, this beer is more drinkable but less extravagantly flavored (and likely also lower in abv). This beer was sampled by three other beer drinkers unaccustomed to barrel-aged beer and each was impressed by it."

It was not barrel aged but used wood from bourbon barrels in the process, and is an imperial porter but there is no category for that on BA. 		Pours a very dark brown with a small head around the sides of the glass. Aroma is outrageous. Like the first sniff of chocolate milk back in elementary school. Then add extra cocoa and some espresso, vanilla, and bourbon. Taste is to die for. All kinds of chocolate, french vanilla ice cream, bourbon, dark roasted coffee, and the smallest hop bitterness for balance. Minimal alcohol presence. Mouthfeel is the best feature. One of the smoothest beers I have ever had. By far the best of the style I have ever had. Drinkability is unlimited. If they bottled this it would be a legend."

The head turns into a thin off-white head on top of a dark brown beer. Not as dark as expected.		Smell is roasted, but not sharp or burned, actually quite mild. The hops are definatelly English, probably Goldings and bitterness is good. The hop aroma is not very pronounced. There is a nice English fruitiness. 		Taste is roasted, but more chocolate malt than roasted barley. A solid base of pale malt gives a somewhat sweet malt taste and to me this is a sweet Porter, a new style. The hops are medium hoppy and bitterness is good. Drinkability is good, for an English beer 5,6% is high, but alcohol is very well hidden."

A: dark reddish amber in colour, the carbonation comes very light and quiet, supporting an equally restricted thin sheet of off-white foam.	S: besides the dominant influence of yeastiness, traditional aroma of Golding-like tangerine-ish fruity hoppiness intertwines with raw-ish nuttiness, boiled root veggie, herbal tea and a touch of brown sugar. Very light and quiet in terms of aroma.	T: a lightly sour-sweet yeasty foretaste backed by powdery biscuity malts, boiled kidney beans and brown malts is ensued by a slightly chewy, ground-root-herb-like bitter-sweetness with a wee bit of spice. Restrained in hop-bitterness in the end while the lightly sour & faintly ""smoky"" (a tad phenolic) yeastiness also lingers. Simplistic.	M&D: quite smooth but slightly flat on the mouthfeel, the body is not thin but slightly too light to be honest. Overall, I don't think this bottle is conditioned as successfully as the other two Conwy RAIB products, as the semi-flat texture doesn't add any positive points to the overall timid performance.

Sadly the head fell away to leave just a collar and a few wisps.		Sweetish hoppy aroma, flowery and semi-citrus at the same time.		Tangy and well carbonated, almost fizzy in the mouth. The beer (according to the label) contains Barley, Wheat and Gluten, as allergy advice. It also claims all their bottled beers are vegetarian.

A: dark amber hue with very good clarity (thanks to a careful pour), coming with a fast dissipating fluffy head and sporadic fizziness (rather large bubbles).	S: lightly metallic and salty notes, spicy-orangey hops, and a rather smooth sugary maltiness hover in the air... somewhat timid in the overall aroma, but in no sense unpleasant.	T: lightly biscuity and faintly honey-ish in the foretaste just like a typical English pale bitter, then the slightly herbal and also spicy bitterness of hops expand in the middle, preceding a rather quiet, soothing aftertaste with a light orangey-citric undertone and lingering waves of semi-herbal bitterness as of the work of phenol.	M&D: for a bottle-conditioned bitter, the texture is pretty clean and not tainted at all by the yeast sediments, making a refreshing and also soft palate; that said, this light-bodied bitter is somehow too timid in taste to sparkle more interests from drinkers (like me). The lingering subtle hop bitterness is very welcomed, though."

Floral honey and earthy hops show up in the middle. It finishes with a dry, slightly toasty malt note as well as moderate hop bitterness.		M - Medium body, moderate carbonation, and a dry finish.		D - The hop bitterness and flavor are quite dominant throughout the beer and tend to suppress the honey, especially in the finish. The malt begins strong but fades towards the finish. It is also lacking in sweetness that could counter the fairly aggressive and musty hops. Not a bad beer, but not particularly well balanced or drinkable either.

According to the beer label, this ""dry, refreshing honeyed ale"" is brewed with Welsh honey from the New Quay Honey Farm. The brewery website also lists down numerous awards won by this beer: 	* Gold award for best golden ale at South Devon CAMRA beer festival 2007. 	* Double Silver Medal winner at SIBA West & Mold beer festivals 2006. 	* Double silver medal at The Great Welsh Beer & Cider festival 2007 & 2008.		A: pours a bright tawny hue with mixture of fine and huge bubbles in action, topped with a lingering white fluffy head.	S: upon the opening, a whiff of skunky note escapes from the bottle, albeit not pungent; in the glass, the aroma has resinous notes of hops, sweet/syrupy orangey citrusness, and intensity of nectar (due to the honey?) all coming before a lighter performance of biscuity malts... a swirl gives rise to a rather focused and clean flow of spicy-floral touch of English hops on top of the settled citrusness (a bit like Challenger to me).	T: the taste is yeasty, earthy and slightly grassy from the start (in a pleasant way), carrying with it a ""settled"" pale ale maltiness (with hints of raw-ish grains) and lightly sour-sweet citric+honey flavour; gradually, the latter two elements (sort of) intertwine to result in a clean palate of lingeringly aromatic honey-malty aftertaste, leaving ample space for the moderate-level hop bitterness with its tangy-citric edge to develop quietly at the back of the palate.	M&D: not bad in terms of bottle-conditioning, as shown by the refreshing (but not sharp) carbonation and a sound body that stays intact throughout the drink; somehow the honey is perhaps (too) well-consumed and leaves little trace in the beer, as compared with malts and citric hops, dragging down the performance a bit if one looks to have adequate honey pleasure of any form in his glass (like me). That said, this is a well-made, dry-ish quaffable golden bitter all the same."

The aroma is just completely overwhelmed by the movie theater butter and butterscotch notes. There are some citrus hops underneath as well, and maybe a little bit of pine.		T: The flavor starts off with quite a bit of alcohol but that is quickly covered up by the incredible butter intensity. More butterscotch than you'd ever care for here. There is a light bitterness to go along with a sort of sharp/abrasive citrus undertone.		M: The body is medium with a very low level of carbonation.		D: This was just awful. I've had some buttery beers before, but this was one of the worst. Don't get this beer."

I remember trips to Pacific Coast back in the late nineties, but this is the first time in years I have seen a bottle from the brewery. A few years old, the bottle pours a somewhat hazy dark brown color. Dark fruits, caramel and oxidation on the nose, and not much different taste-wise.

A spicy, roasty, and malty aroma with cocoa powder coming through loud and clear. The taste followed suit  lots of cocoa, roast, dark malt, and yeast or hops sneaking in at the end to round it out.

The nose detected subtle molasses notes though not an overwhelming sense. The palate gets a toasty malt bite with aftertaste. Like I said, it was smooth.

Mouthfeel is medium bodied: the alcohol is well hidden, making it ok drinkable too.		This strong lager is actually not bad at all."

Taste: Excruciatingly thin flavor of ultra pale malts imparting a touch of sweetness and a hint of sourish grains. Sparsely spicy hops with just enough light bitterness to be noticed. The finish is both dry, clean, and crisp, but somewhat short, so Amstel Light is a lot like life, really. One minute it's there, and the nex---		Mouthfeel: Light-bodied. Medium-plus carbonation.

A definite cooked vegetable flavor is quite apparent, unfortunately. There is a hint of herbal hop bite towards the finish. 		M: Typically thin-bodied. Carbonation lends some crispness, but not enough to really be appealing. A dry finish. 		D: This beer's popularity is about as damning an indictment of the light lager style as I can find.

A very light malt addition and even less when it comes to hops and a bit of corn in the back. When it warmed this smelled downright skunky.		T- The smell on this pretty much sums up the taste as well. Grain, malt, and just a touch of bitterness on the end. Some yeast comes out but does not enhance the flavor. A taste of corn has me thinking this is a glorified american macro, even though im being very generous with the word glorified.		M- Thin, light and watery with a big blast of carbonation. Swishing this in the mouth really brings out the grain bill. They were not lying when they said this was a light lager.		D- The ABV on this was actually 1.5% less than what I thought it would be, now I see why people can drink the hell out of this at a bar or similiar setting, but I ask myself why, this stuff taste like impending doom.

The aroma was typical light lager - malt, grain, cooked corn, skunk. The taste followed the aroma. Not much here but a tad better than a BMC so my goto beer in a BMC only place.		Overall, a step above a BMC. The default choice for me when it's this or a BMC. Goes down easy enough but not much flavor. Not a player in the home rotation."
1000,Amstel Light,436,163,3.5,Light Lager,3,3,3,3,3,1245822612,hustlesworth,"A- super pale extra light golden, dense white head, holds a very thin ring upon receding, little spots of lace.		S- pale grains, some banana, light floral hops, like a very very very mild blond ale bspa.		T- somewhat fruity, banana, mango, with a weak grassy hop bite, and some white bread. very mild and unoffensive, a flash of toasty flavor in the clean finish.		MF- thin and fizzy... just like a light lager. crisp for sure.		D- thirst quenching, mild, and easy going. flavor is totally non aggressive and laid back, this is the beer that made me start liking beer sometime back in the early 90's."
